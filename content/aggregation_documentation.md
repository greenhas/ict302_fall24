All code needs to be added to the *front matter* at the beginning of the postâ€“that is, between the two sets of `+++` before you get to the "main content" of the post.

## author

Add yourself as `author` to all of your posts with the following code:

`author = "your name here"`

Your name needs to be consistent across all posts for this to work properly!

## categories

We will use categories to sort posts by assignment type. You can use the following code to do so: 

`categories = ["assignment type here"]`

You should replace `assignment type here` with one of the following, making sure to pay attention to typos:

* `content definition`
* `UGC definition`
* `aggregation definition`
* `presentation definition`
* `management definition`
* `CMS definition`

## tags

We will use tags as a more freeform way of describing what different posts contain in terms of content. You can use the following code to do so:

`tags = ["tag 1 here","tag 2 here","tag 3 here"]`

What tags you use are up to you, but think about what might be helpful for someone who wants to see what we're writing about!
