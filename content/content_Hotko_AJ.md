Content as defined by Deane Barker, “Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.” Barker, D.( 2016). My definition of content if fairly simple, anything that humans consume that is created by humans. Some examples of content would be websites, movies, and even YouTube videos. A movie is an example of content because it was created by humans and intended for human consumption.
