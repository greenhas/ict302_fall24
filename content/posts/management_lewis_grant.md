â€œA wide-ranging term that generally refers to defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary

What is content management to me? From the quote above, CM is how content is organized and presented. This can be due to how the content is organized, stored, and delivered to a person. Beyond that, with content management, it could also mean who gets to see the content and who can't.
