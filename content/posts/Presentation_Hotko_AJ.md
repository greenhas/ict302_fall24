## Presentation Defined 
“The general concept and processes around modifying content for displaying in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.” (Barker, 2016). 
## My definition of Presentation 
I see presentation as the visual appearance of content and how it can be formatted in different ways. 
## Example of Presentation 
An example of presentation would be looking at how news articles on websites are presented. On the [google news](https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) home page we can see pictures and summaries of different articles. Once we click on an article that we would like to read we notice that the content is the same as the summary plus some more information. The only real difference is that the presentation has changed.
