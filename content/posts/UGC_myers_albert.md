## **What is** *"user-generated content*"
"User-generated content (UGC) is published information that an unpaid contributor provides to a website" (Yasar, 2022). Somebody puts out photo or video into the public domain that anhyone can use.

Social media posts are great examples of UGC. One video can be circulated to potentially multiple different accounts that then give the original person credit for the use of their post. These posts can give someone a potential platform to use.
