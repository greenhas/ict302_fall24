## Content Management Scenario 
 A Content Management scenario that I may find myself in again would be working as a managed services intern over the summer. Content that I would be managing would be tickets that are assigned to me. There could be instances in which organization of the tickets would be very important. Organizing them in a way which allows me to work on something even when I may need to wait for further information. I would mostly be managing text content this being the tickets which give me information on how I need to work on something. This would be a team effort. I would be using teams to communicate with coworkers along with ConnectWise as the ticketing system. 
 ## Compare Hugo and WordPress
 In terms of a Content Management System, I am looking for something with the capabilities of improving my organization, allows me to clearly see deadlines, and displays vital information (names, emails). Customizability within the contentment management system would also be great being able to organize information in a way that is most efficient for the user. Comparing and Contrasting Hugo and Wordpress. I really like the customizability of both having plugins which allow for further organization. I personally prefer the means of publishing content on WordPress rather than Hugo.
