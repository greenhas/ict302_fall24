### Content management

Definition *"A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.* - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary

In other words, *"Content management is how we handle the information we share on websites and apps. It's all about keeping everything in order so people can find what they need easily."*


## Example:
A example of content management is Netflix. They add new movies and TV shows, organize them by genre, and update recommendations based on what users watch. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com).
