## What is Content?

According to the slides and *Deane Barker*, content is created by editorial process and intended for consumption by a human audience.
To me, content is anything we humans create and put onto the internet. Anything from blogposts, to videos, to music, to images: all of it is content!

## An Example
One example of *content* in action is [this awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlzmsTiOJnU&pp=ygUdY2xhaXJlIHNhZmZpdHogY2lubmFtb24gcm9sbHM%3D) by Claire Saffitz. In this video, she demonstrates one of her recipes from her book. This content is **created by her** and is **intended for us to consume**. In this instance, it is meant to entertain and inform us about cooking!
