## Workflow implementation

The very first step that we should take is communicating on teams. Brainstorm on their and publish our ideas. Taking our brainstorm to the next step then implenting them into wordpress. After this, edits will be done to make sure that this process goes by smoothly. After everything is approved, we can finally ad the finishing touches then publish them to the website. 

## Class expectations 

I think that people should work on all roles; however, if people are not comfortable enough about working directly with wordpress, then they should focus on other tasks. People that are comfortable working on the backend and frontend should have a seperate chat to discuss the easiest ways of doing things so the website itself doesn't get complicated. I think that the way we setup and discussed in class will work perfectly for us in the coming months.
