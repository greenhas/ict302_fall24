## What is Content Aggregation? 

In *Web Content Management*, author Deane Barker defines content aggregation as "an intentional grouping of content for purposes of organization or presentation" (Barker, 2016). 

In other words, this means that content aggregation is the way that content is displayed on a website in order for users to view said content via either the organization of the website or the terms that the user chooses to see. Content aggregation is simply the way that the content is displayed with other content on websites. This content can be grouped by the website administrator for purposes of organization or navigtion, or it can be returned by users who filter content through various built-in organizational methods on a site, such as running a search for specific things on a website, or using tags to filter. 
## Content Aggregation Example

An example of content aggregation would be a Wikipedia article. For this activity, let's use [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up). 

In this example, the content is aggregated by being grouped together under headings. Each paragraph in the Wikipedia article is a different example of content, and the paragraphs/sections are grouped under relevant headings so the user can easily find what they are looking for. Additionally, the different links on the Wikipedia article that link to other networked Wikipedia articles also display content aggregation techniques, because they allow this article to serve as a hub or repository for other related articles, letting the user continue browsing other related topics that they may be researching.
