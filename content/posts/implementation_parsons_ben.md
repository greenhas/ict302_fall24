## Using WordPress, Teams, and Other Technologies for Workflow

- **WordPress**: We'll use WordPress to create and publish. Everyone will draft content and submit it through WordPress.
  
- **Microsoft Teams**: We'll use Microsoft Teams to brainstorm our ideas with the class and our groups. This will also be used as a type of checklist to make sure we get everything done. 

- **Other Technologies**: We'll use other technologies to stay in touch with our peers outside of class to give extra feedback or ideas.

## Expectations for Using These Tools

- **Communication**: Everyone should be active on Teams, giving feedback and sharing updates in a timely manner. 

- **Reporting Info**: People need to keep in touch with group members and the project manager for any new information or ideas being shared. 

- **Submitting Content**: Our brainstorming and our checklist on Teams should be completed prior to submission. We also need to make sure everyone is done and ready for their work to be published.
