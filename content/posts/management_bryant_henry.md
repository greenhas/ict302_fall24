## What is Content Management? 

In *Flying Squirrel Glossary*, author Deane Barker defines content management as a "wide-ranging" term that refers to the "practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content" (Barker, 2016). 

In other words, this means that content management is the process of working with and processing the content that a user sees on a particular platform before the user gets to see the content. 
## Content Management Example

An example of content management would be this blog post, or more specifically, the blog posts on our ICT 302 class website, linked [here](https://ict302fall24.netlify.app/). 

For this example, the concept of content management is illustrated as follows: As the content creators, we are responsible for all aspects of the content that users see on the ICT 302 class blog post. We create the content, edit it, review it, publish it to the website, and so on. Before the visitors to our blog even see the individual posts made by myself and my classmates, we are all hard at work managing the content behind the scenes and making sure that it's appropriately viewable on the site.
