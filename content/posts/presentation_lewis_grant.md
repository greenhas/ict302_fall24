"Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it's shown." -Mauricio Harp.
For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.

One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting. But by doing so, they make the content engaging and grab people's attention. They add charts or visuals. I can say that presentation can change how people interact with content; for example, if I read an article on space, including a picture, it grabs my attention and can drive me or another reader to learn more about the topic.
