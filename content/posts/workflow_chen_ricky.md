## Phases to Pass Through

First, identify the problem/goal, know the what is the final goal of this task


Second, braindstorm ideas and assigning the right person for this specific task


Third, drafts should be made including the different ideas in he brainstorm


Fourth, an editor/publisher should review the final draft to make edits, suggestion, etc


Finally, post into the site after majorities's approval


## Roles

Roles will be important to increase the effiency of the workflow. We will need a contributor role, someone who writes the drafts. An editor role, someone who edits the drafts from contributor, whether it's spelling check, grammar, making it make sense. A admin role who manages everything to make sure nothing in the site goes wrong. The admin role will also be the one to approve everything. Finally a designer in the site will help visually appealing for the audience.
