**Workflow Phases:**

Plannig Phase:
In this phase, the task is clearly defined. The goals, deadlines, and required deliverables are identified. Roles are assigned to classmates, and expectations are set.

Creating Phase:
In this phase we produce the content itself, whether it's writing, designing visuals, or creating multimedia.

Reviewing Phase:
After the content is created, it is passed to one or more reviewers for feedback. This phase ensures that the content is accurate, aligns with project goals, and meets quality standards.

Revising Phase:
Based on the feedback from the review, necessary changes are made. 

Approving Phase:
Once revisions are complete, the content is checked one last time by the Task Manager or reviewer to ensure it's ready for publication or submission.

Publishing Phase:
In this final phase, the content is published or distributed to the intended audience.
