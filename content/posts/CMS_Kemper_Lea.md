  According to Wikipedia a content management system is computer software used to manage the creation and editing of digital content. This software helps people create, organize, edit, and manage digital content like text, images, and videos. CMS provides a user-friendly interface with little coding. Instagram is my most used CMS, I plan all of the tattoo parlors' social media posts through their platform. This also allows me to post the same content on Facebook as well. For example this weekend I made a post with pictures, videos, links to a raffle, and music, simply by uploading this content to Instagram templates.
