According to Deane Barker Presentation is, **""The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered."""**

To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once. 

An example of presention is [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qUirMmzA__i5-y8k8ugkhJDx31sJ3JVs1z8wyC0lUjs/edit?usp=sharing) of a presentation I was apart of. 

This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.
