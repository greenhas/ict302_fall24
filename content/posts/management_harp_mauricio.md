**Definition**: Content management is a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content" (Barker, 2024)

**Explanation in own words**: Content management involves handling every step of the content lifecycle, from planning and creating to reviewing, organizing, and delivering it to the audience

**Real-life example**: I use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), an example of content management. YouTube creators upload and manage their videos, organized through channels and search algorithms. 

YouTube uses content management by allowing creators to upload and organize their videos while securing them. It also shows how content is delivered to users through recommendations.
