### What is User-Generated Content?

The definition of this concept according to Deane Barker is “Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website.” (Barker, 2016).
### definition of user generated content in my own words

 User-generated content is all about the everyday person creating and sharing stuff online. . Whether it’s a funny meme, a tutorial on how to bake the perfect cake. it’s a great way for people to connect over common interests.

### A Real-Life Example

One of my favorite examples of UGC is the **Tasty** channel on YouTube. They showcase tons of cooking videos that not only feature their own recipes but also encourage viewers to submit their creations. Check it out here: [Tasty YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty).

### How This Fits into UGC

The Tasty channel is a perfect example of user-generated content in action. It invites people to share their own cooking hacks and recipes, creating a vibrant community of food lovers. Plus, viewers get to see different takes on the same dish, which is super inspiring. This platform turns cooking into a shared experience rather than just a solo activity, showing how UGC can bring people together around a common passion.
