## What Even Is User-Generated Content?
When speaking about content on the Internet, it is almost impossible not to mention user-generated content. There are millions of new pieces of content on the internet every day, and they don't just appear out of thin air, they are fueled	by people like me and you. UGC was referred to as 
*"Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website"* 
by Deane Barker. To me, UGC is simply just content created by users for different platforms. 
## Examples of UGC
There are plenty of UGC examples on the internet, and forums are almost completely run by them, like this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/17p52my/general_proper_way_to_jump_start_a_car/) in a mechanic advice thread on how to properly jumpstart a car. This post was published on Reddit by a user for free. They don't work for Reddit, but they are still able to add content to their platform at will. Not all sites are as "user-driven," but having the ability for your users to create content saves the owners time and money while also getting their own inspiration from their users.
