##Defining "Content Aggregation" 

In Deane Barker's words, content aggregation is, "An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation" (Barker).

##In my own words...

I would say that it really just makes it easier to find specific things on websites, since it uses grouping and organization.

##Examples?

First thing that comes to mind is Reddit. Reddit's home page is super simple and is easy to navigate for new users, [Reddit Home Page](https://www.reddit.com/) . If you are using reddit on the computer, on the left side there are topics that you can browse through. If you are interested in movies/tv you can just click on this topic ( which is a great example of content aggregation ).
