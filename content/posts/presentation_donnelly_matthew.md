## Defining Presentation 

Dean Barker gave a great definition of presentation, he said that presentation is, "The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered." (Barker, 2013). 

## In my own *words* 

Presentation is how you view something in it's simpliest form. It is how you see a website, and how easiliy or hard you can navigate through it. Considering what kind of presentation is best for your audiance is extremely important, as it could either make quality of life better or frustrating for users to naviagte and view. 

## Presentation examples

I have adobe express in mind. Adobe express lets users create instagram stories, has website templates, and much more. These are some of the templates on [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/new?width=1080&height=1920&unit=px&taskID=instagram-story&pixelsPerInch=96&aspectRatioLock=true&pageCount=1&category=templates&assetCollection=urn%3Aaaid%3Asc%3AVA6C2%3A4a4fcb01-4152-46ef-9b85-4adf3024d1fd) . There are over 13,000 templates to choice from for instagram stories, varying from basketball, music, etc. 

Being able to choose from so many options is important for social media creators, and there is basically something for everyone. If there was just one template for everybody to use, it would be boring and a lot of the times just wouldn't make sense for some stories.
