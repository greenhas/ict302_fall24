## What is Presentation?


According to Deane Barker, "Content from its aesthetic surrounding, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."

## To my Understanding


Presentation is how content is show. Regardless how presentation has changed, the content will still be the same.


## Example


An example of presentation is themes for Shopify. Here is an example ->
[Shopify Theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes)


This is example of presentation. Shopify is a platform that lets entrepreneur sell things online. In Shopify user can change the theme easily while keeping their content the same. Keeping what they're selling still in the website. There is more than just themes to change, user can change how they want to show their products, changing colors, and etc. All for a better experince for the consumer, different themes can boost sales.
