##What is Content?

**Content** is created in an editorial process and designed for human consumption. In the editorial process, content is often influenced by the creators' vision, voice, and guidelines of the platform or organization, in order to convey a certain message. I post content for the Tattoo parlor I work for. I use Instagram, Facebook, and our website to distribute pictures, videos, and announcements. To keep up to date with trends I regularly consume content from other tattoo artist posts. As a consumer of this content, I can shift my perspective and become a better editor for my shop page.
