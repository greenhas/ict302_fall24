## What is content management?

Deane Barker says that content management is the “practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content” (Barker 2016). 

** In my own words

I would say that content management is a way to make viewing and navigating websites easier, for users and for the creators of that website as well. It is a way of organzing types of content on websites.

## Example

This is a photographer and youtuber that I watch all the time, he even has his own website. [GxAce](https://gxace.com/) he has a shop where you can buy lightroom presents, a contact page and even a focal length calculator. All of these things go together with content management because he is organzing his content for buyers and fans to view.
