## Content Management Systems  

> We've finally arrived at the name of the class!

A Content Management System (CMS), is defined as, "A content management system (CMS) is a software package that provides some level of automation for the tasks required to effectively manage content." [^1]

To me, content management systems a tool used to gather, edit, and publish content for the purpose of efficiency and organization. They can vastly improve workflow and save tons of time, and can be flexible in their design to fit the user or company's needs.

### Real examples

An example I can think of for a content management system is YouTube's Creator Studio or Twitch's Creator Dashboard. In both of these cases, I use these tools all the time to organize my content, which are live streams and videos. I can change titles, export them onto different platforms, download them, edit their metadata, change monetization options, and a whole host of other options. These tools have been incredibly life-changing and have allowed me to make content creation one of my primary focuses in life and a stream of income for me.
