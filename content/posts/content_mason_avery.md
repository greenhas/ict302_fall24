“Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.” Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media

I understand this concept as the creation of something with humans as the consumers. Videos, movies, podcasts, interviews, books and journals are some examples. Authors write books with the hopes that someone consumes them, i.e. reads their work. A chef creates a dish that he hopes customers will enjoy etc. 

Content I regularly consume is KSR (Kentucky sports radio) podcasts they broadcast on Spotify.  https://open.spotify.com/show/3cC4WCo3dRyk9OIGB0I3eV?si=ba0acf68bdff4136

In this podcast the hosts discuss the sports scene regarding University of Kentucky sports teams. With their goal of other fans listening to what they discuss. Professional podcasts still follow the editorial process as well, specifically editing before publishing it to a platform.
