**Content** is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication. In my own words, content is information available for either retrieval or engagement intended for users and people.
One example of content that I consume regularly are golf youtube videos posted by Bryson DeChambeau. [Here is my link](https://youtu.be/1Rc37QkkbGg?si=H0Ub7dX0r2hTp8z5)
This example illustrates the concept of content as I, the user, engage with the information, the video of Bryson golfing and giving tips as he plays, and by watching it I consume it, and the videos are edited before they are posted.
