### what is content aggregation

 content aggregation is “An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation” Barker, D. (2016). 
 
 ### Explanation of Content Aggregation in My Own Words
 
 
 content aggregation involves gathering relevant articles, videos, and other media from various websites and platforms, then presenting them together so users can find and consume information more easily.

### Real-Life Example of Content Aggregation

One source of content that I regularly consume is [Feedly](https://feedly.com). Feedly is a content aggregation tool that allows users to subscribe to various blogs, news sites, and online publications. 


This example illustrates the concept of content aggregation perfectly, as Feedly collects and organizes content from diverse sources, enabling me to efficiently access information on subjects that interest me.
