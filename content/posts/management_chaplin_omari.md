## Content Management

Our slides define "content management" as, "A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content." - [Deane Barker](https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/content-management/)

For me, I think of content managment as the thing that we or a team do to create, manage, manipulate, and organize the content we produce or otherwise have authority over. We make choices and decisions that we can make that will change how this content exists.

As my example of what content management is, I refer to the people on the web communications team at UK [seen here](https://web.uky.edu/people), and the tasks they perform. I'm very familiar with one of the people on this team, and in this role, they have access to UK's websites and content on them. Through communications with the colleges and within their own team, they discuss and make choices on how to manage the huge amount of content in UK's web pages. They approve, edit, publish, create, and can even remove or block access to content if the situation calls for it! I believe, after closer inspection of what they do, they are actively engaging in content management.
