Content aggregation is "An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation" Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary.

This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders. This is executing intentional grouping of content. As for some of my trips, I purposefully group them in a file and can then sort by my rating, date, and location where I took the photos. You can get nit-picky in which you want to organize the images.
