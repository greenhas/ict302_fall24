> ## **What is** *"content*
Dash talks about the phrase user generated content and how the people who generated this conent did not like the way the phrase represented them. He also talks about how a lot of younger people today refer to themselves as content creators. (Richman, 2022)

In my own words I think content is any form of consumable visual element that someone makes for someone else to view. 

>## **Content Example**

Streaming is a great example of why people call themselves comntent creators. I have a [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/xirrelevxnt) where I produce content whenever I stream. 

Now there is no editing while streaming, but I still produce a consumable visual element for someone else to view. The only reason why people call themseleves content creators is if they have reached enough followers to start earning money from streaming. In order to be a content creator you need a large following amount. Then that large following  amount either needs to pay a $5 monthly subscription or the content creator needs to run ads to make some form of revenue.
