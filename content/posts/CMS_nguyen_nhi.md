## Definition 

"A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content."

Deane Barker, Web Content Management Glossary

In other words, a CMS lets you build and run a website without having to be a web developer. 

## Example

 A example of a CMS is my favorite recipe blog, [Apple Pie by Grandma Ople](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/). The person running the blog can add new recipes, edit old ones, and organize all the content in categories like “pie” or “cakes.”
