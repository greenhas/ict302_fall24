According to Dr. Barker, content management systems are, **"A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content."

My definition of content management systems are is a software application that allows users to create, edit, manage, and publish digital content, without needing advanced technical skills like coding.

An example of a content management system is the WordPress site that we are doing our class project on.

My example illustrates the concept because WordPress is used to create, edit, manage, and publish content for people.
