## Defining "user generated content" 

User generated content is typically "generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website" (Barker). UCG is extremely broad, really anything that anybody posts/replies to can be considered for this; however, to me I would say that it is content created by users, for others to view.

## Examples of UCG

[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/2l9z1y/setting_up_a_home_darkroom_difficult/) This is a simple example of UCG. Even though this post is about 10 years old, this user was asking questions on how to set up a darkroom. I use reddit all of the time if I need inspiration or just have any questions. But there are many other websites that you can find UCG on.
