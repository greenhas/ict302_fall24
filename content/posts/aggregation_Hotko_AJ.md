## Content Aggregation Defined 
“an intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organizations or presentation” (Barker, 2016).
## My Interpretation of Content Aggregation 
My interpretation of content aggregation is that It organizes content in a logical manner in which it is easier to consume
## Example of Content Aggregation - Instagram 
A user can easily see content from creators in that they are following simply just by scrolling. On the bottom the screen the user has the options to make a post of their own, search for specific content, access an area in which they can see content posted by anyone even if they are not following them, and view their own profile. This style of content aggregation has everything organized in such a way that makes it very easy for the user to navigate.
