## How to utilize our tools

First, everyone takes the roles survey and gets assigned a role they're comfortable with


Second, with the tasks in the teams group, Dr. Greenhalgh assigns each member a task. OR every member go in the get a task they like and complete their task then move on to the next one


Third, after the task is complete, mark it complete, type a descrption or screenshot of the result and put it in Teams.


## Reasonable Expectations

Everyone use Teams to commmunicate on what task is completed, or give feedback on the task completed by other members. On github we can also add a descriptions on what is done as well. I expect at least one task done per one or two days by each member. Assuming the moment everyone get in class and start working. If task is not finished that class period, finish it at the end of the day. There are some tasks that must be done before doing other tasks. Of course there are some tasks that needs extra assistance.
