## What is Content Aggregation?


According to Deane Barker, "An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation." 

Barker, D.(2016). [Web Content Management](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/content-aggregation/). O'Reilly Media


## To my Understanding


Content Aggregation is a specific way to organize content to show to the public.


## Example


An example of content aggregation is news pages. Here is an example ->
[Google News](https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en)


This is example of content aggregation. Currently the page is the same for evveryone, in the public. It also has a "For you" section where if user visit Google News frequently and brower through their interest of news, Google News will generate more topics in the "For you" section so the users can stay in their website for longer. They organized their content for specific interest to the user to present to the public.
