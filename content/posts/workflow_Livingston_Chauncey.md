## Task Phases
I think there should be couple phases for the tasks starting with deciding what the task is and how indepth it will be. Next, we should decide which part of the website the task belongs to, is it part fo the main home page or is it part of an external link? Once that's figured out that will determine who it goes to and they can begin to work on it. Once their done we'll do a review and make sure it is correct and functional and go from there.

## Different Roles
As far as roles, I don't have too many ideas other than splitting people up by parts of the website by groups for example, there will be one team that does the home page and another that does the resources tab. Then, within those groups, we can have people who focus on different aspects one may focus on presentation and the other content.
