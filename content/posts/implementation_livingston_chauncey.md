## How will it be done?
We will have our multiple types of tasks separated into categories on Microsoft Teams, where the different groups can access them. Then, we can use those tasks to divide the work in WordPress. As far as the expectations of each person, it goes without saying that we expect everyone to do their role and, if they are struggling with their role, to ask for assistance. This can be done through teams or through our canvas shell.
