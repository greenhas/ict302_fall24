**What is content management?**

"A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, oraganizing,securing,reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content." (Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary)

**In my own words**

Content management is the process of handling digital content, from creating and editing to organizing and publishing it.

**Example**

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a widely known content management system specifically designed for e-commerce. It allows users to create and manage online stores, providing tools for product management, payment processing, and order fulfillment, making it easier for businesses to sell products online.
