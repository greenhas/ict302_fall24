**Content management** is a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.
 I got this definition from [the class slides](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/_302_2024_w6_c1.html#50).
 In my own words, content management is the collection, management, and publication of any form of information or content through a platform.
For my example, I think WordPress serves as a great example of content management. I say this as WordPress allows users to create, edit, and manage their content, which directly lines up with the definition of content management.
