## What is Content? 

According to Deane Barker in *Web Content Management*, content can be defined as information that was "produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption" (Barker, 2016). 

In other words, this means that content is something that an individual put effort into creating and that was designed and created for another individual to interact with in a meaningful way. 

## Content Example

An example of content that I consume would be a YouTube video. I watch YouTube every day and I've seen many different videos on the platform. For the purposes of this, I'll use the videos from one of my favorite YouTube channels, [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium). 

For this example, the concept of content is illustrated in the following ways: First, the channel creator, Veritasium (real name Derek Muller), invests time (and obviously money as well, given the large cost of video production equipment and editing software) into filming, researching, and editing these videos. Additionally, these videos are shared on YouTube for other individuals to watch and interact with. Interacting with the videos could mean liking them or subscribing to the channel, but it could also mean that the viewer learns an interesting piece of information about science or technology that they might not have known before. In short, this fulfills my definition of content because an individual expended various resources into it (put in effort) for the purposes of the media being interacted with by other individuals as described above.
