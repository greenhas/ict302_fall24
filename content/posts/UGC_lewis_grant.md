##User Generated Content

In the past week, we have discussed user-generated content and its meaning. User-generated content or media created by a human. In the Podcast Episode: Wordle and the Web We Need a Podcast on EFF, the hosts talk about the meaning and what they feel by it. One of the hosts says it was crazy that people now refer to media or art, such as music, as content and sometimes not as its correct form, even when it comes from the heart. 

I only see user-generated content as human-made, especially in the age of AI. Such as photos with new AI generators made by AI. Sure, a person had to write a prompt, but the human is not doing the work. I believe this is the most bare bone explanation as the definition of user-generated content is not complex.
