## Workflow Implementation 
The correct implementation of Wordpress and Teams will be very beneficial to our workflow. Teams will be used for gathering ideas and turning them into tasks. There could even be different chats for different roles and elements that need to be worked on so no information gets lost. Overall, teams is going to be more of an organizational and communication factor to ensure that nobody in confused on what they need to do. Wordpress is what is going to be used in order to turn these tasks into the real thing. 
## Class Expectations 
I believe that Teams would be a great way for the class to communicate, if someone needs to reach out to someone they could do it there opposed to emailing them. I think all tasks should be listed into teams so everyone can have an idea of what is going on, then tasks could be split up depending on what roles should take care of them. I think using Wordpress would definitely depend on what someoneâ€™s role is, some people may have to become more familiar with it than others. Though, I think everyone is going to have to use it at some point.
