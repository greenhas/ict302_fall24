## Let's Make a Plan! 

> We need to think about how our workflow will go...

We have a few technologies available to us that we can use to implement and execute our workflow in WordPress, Teams, e-mail, Canvas, and any other technologies we bring into consideration.


### We can use these tools to:

* Communicate with each other (text or voice)
* Set deadlines and due dates on calendars
* Share data and progress
* Screenshare
* Setup and attend group meetings
* Test and preview ideas



## Reasonable Expectations

We should expect each other to use these technologies for the reasons listed above and more in order to get our work done efficiently.

* Communicate what tasks are being delegated and to whom they will be important so that there isn't overlap between work.

* Checking in and checking off when tasks are completed on Teams will help organize our workflow and should be done by everyone.

* If running into any issues, notifying classmates or our admin with email and Teams should be done immediately.
