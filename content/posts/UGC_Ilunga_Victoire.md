## Definition of User-Generated Content
I would define User-generated content as content made by regular users or customers that is usually shared on social media or other platforms. According to the article "A Straightforward Approach to User Generated Content that Connects," user content is is original, brand-specific content created by customers (at no cost to you) and published on social media or other channels (Oladipo, 2022).

**Example**: A popular platform where UGC thrives is Instagram. Users create and post photos or videos, share stories, and engage with others through comments and likes. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
