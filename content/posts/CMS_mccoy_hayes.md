## What is a content management system to me?

edit, publish, and organize content. With a CMS you dont need to do much or any
coding; everything is there for you to plug and play.

## How is Shopify a CMS?

Shopify is an e-commerce CMS. This helps business owners or online retailers market
and sell their products. There are options to build a webpage for your business, and
this can include things like blog posts, online shopping platforms, and media. What
makes this different from other content management systems that I have used before 
is its eCommererce 
capabilities. This allows you to make an online store where you can list products,
process payments, and track analytics. This kind of CMS helps small businesses and
entreprenuers make a website for their products and keep transactions secure, which 
can be difficult for a small business who might not have the knowledge on these things.
