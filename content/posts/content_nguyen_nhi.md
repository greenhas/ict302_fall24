## What is Content?

The definition of this concept definition that I've chosen is *"Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication."*

Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media

In other words, the explanation of this concept is *"Content is the information expressed through video, audio, images that we create with the intention to share, educate, and engage with people."*

This illustrates the concept of *Content* because this Instagram post provides information that the creator wants to share with people about the event. There are location, the time, what people can expect from the event.
