## What is Content?

The definition of this concept definition that I've chosen is *"Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication."*

Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media

In other words, the explanation of this concept is *Content is information or ideas shared in different formats like text, images, videos, or audio. It can be found on websites, social media, blogs, and more, and is created to inform, entertain, or engage an audience."*

This illustrates the concept of *Content* because this Instagram post from the University of Kentucky Student Activities Board uses both text and visuals to engage students. The image shows fruits and vegetables with the event details clearly displayed on a wooden sign, which makes it easy to understand. The caption is also fun and inviting, starting with the phrase "An apple a day keeps the doctor away," and goes on to explain that students can pick up free produce and tote bags at the event. It's clear that the goal is to get students interested in attending the event, which is exactly what good content should do.
