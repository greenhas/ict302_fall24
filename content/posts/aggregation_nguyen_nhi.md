### User-generated Content
The definition of this concept is *"An intentional grouping of content for purposes of organization or presentation."* (Barker, 2016)

Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary

In other words, the explanation for this concept is *"The content aggregation gathers content based on certain criteria, such as a topic or keyword, making it easier for users to discover relevant content without manually searching for it."*

## Example
One example I use is [Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com). Pinterest aggregates pictures, social media posts, and collections based on the keywords and tags you use to search the specific contents you want to see. They also have recommendation for you to keep engaging.
