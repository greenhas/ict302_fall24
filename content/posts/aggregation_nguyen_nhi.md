### User-generated Content
The definition of this concept is *"An intentional grouping of content for purposes of organization or presentation."* (Barker, 2016)

Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary

In other words, the explanation for this concept is *"The content aggregation gathers content based on certain criteria, such as a topic or keyword, making it easier for users to discover relevant content without manually searching for it."*

## Example
One example I use is [Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com). if I'm looking for design inspiration, Pinterest aggregates relevant content such as blog posts, portfolio images, and design ideasâ€”from various sources and allows me to "pin" them to a virtual board.
