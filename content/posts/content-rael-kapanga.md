### what is content:
Dash discusses the term "user-generated content" and how many of the people who create this content feel that the phrase doesn't accurately represent them. He also notes that many younger individuals today prefer to call themselves "content creators" instead. (Richman, 2022)


in my own term, content is  refers to any information or material that is created, shared, and consumed through various forms of media. It can include text, images, videos, audio, or a combination of these elements, and is used to inform, entertain, engage, or educate an audience.

## Example of Content Creation: Marques Brownlee on YouTube

One source of content I regularly consume is **YouTube**, specifically the **Marques Brownlee** channel, where he reviews the latest tech products and gadgets. Here's a link to his channel: [Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee).

This channel is a perfect example of the concept of **content creation**. Marques Brownlee consistently produces videos that combine visual (video), auditory (commentary, interviews), and textual (on-screen graphics) elements to create engaging tech reviews. He doesn't just upload raw footage; instead, he crafts each video to inform, entertain, and connect with his audience. His content ranges from in-depth reviews to commentary on tech industry trends.

Marques Brownlee illustrates the concept of content because he generates all these materials himself and shares them on a digital platform for others to consume. This is exactly what **content** isâ€”any form of information or material (like text, videos, images) that serves a purpose, whether it's educating, entertaining, or providing value to an audience.
