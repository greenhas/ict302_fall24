## Content Management System Defined 
As defined by Deane Barker, “A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.” (The Web Content Management Glossary, Barker 2016).
## My Understanding 
Content Management Systems or CMS’s are software that users can use in which help them deliver and organizer content. The software can be used to make creating a website or an app more efficient since a CMS would do certain parts of the process automatically allowing the user to focus on other things. 
## Example of CMS 
The best example that I came up with would be [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/templates). Users who don’t have the knowledge or time to develop their own website from scratch can use Squarespace to put it together for them. This is done by choosing various different templates and pre-coded elements to the website. All the user has to worry about is how they want the website to look and what content they will be displaying.
