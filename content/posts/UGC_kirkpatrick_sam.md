## What is User-Generated Content?  
User-generated content (UGC) refers to any form of content created and shared by users of an online platform rather than the platform's administrators or professionals. It includes videos, images, reviews, and blog posts. Kaplan and Haenlein (2010), "UGC is the sum of all ways in which people make use of social media by creating and sharing content."

## Explaining UGC  
In simple terms, UGC is any content that regular people (not brands or professionals) make and share online. It’s what powers social media, forums, and review sites—it makes platforms interactive and engaging.

## Real-Life Example of UGC  
An good example is **Reddit**, a platform where users create posts, comment, and upvote content across countless communities. [Check it out here.](https://www.reddit.com)

On Reddit, users drive the content entirely, making it a perfect illustration of UGC. For instance, in the subreddit *AskReddit*, members post questions and answers, shaping conversations that wouldn’t exist without their contributions.

## How This Example Illustrates UGC  
Reddit showcases UGC by relying on its community to generate all the discussions, links, and media. It thrives because of the diversity and creativity of its users, embodying the core idea of user-generated content.
