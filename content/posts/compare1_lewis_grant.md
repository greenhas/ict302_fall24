A situation that I would most like to run into and need a content management system is if I were to start my own business. If I were starting my own business, I would be more inclined to use WordPress, as it has been straightforward. I would use WordPress to create a site for my clients to visit and learn more about my IT services and how my company can help them and address their needs. I would use WordPress for business purposes and make a portal where my clients could easily access any information they wanted. I would also create a way for clients to contact me via contact information on said website. I can use WordPress to show projects we have done and post videos about our company. The website would also include text and photo media to show our work. 

In this company, our choice of CMS would have to be WordPress. I would be looking for a platform that makes it easy to quickly share videos, photos, and text media on a website. Another reason I would choose WordPress is the ease of use, which almost anyone could learn just by spending time with the CMS. I could be more skilled with website design, but I found it easy to understand and navigate through when helping make our class website. 	I also believe that with plug-ins that are offered, we could increase the security of the website as well as add features to improve accessibility for users as well as employees.
