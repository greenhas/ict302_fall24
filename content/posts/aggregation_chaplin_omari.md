## What is "content aggregation"?

According to the slides and *Deane Barker*, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.

Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.

## An Example
When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them. As you can see in the [Liminal Spaces Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/?f=flair_name%3A%22Video%20Game%22), I linked to the flairs that specified "Video Games". Therefore, I can find posts easily that match that description!
