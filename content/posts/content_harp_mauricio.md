Definition of Content:
Content is information created through a report for humans to see through publication. It is organized and tailored to convey a message, provide entertainment, or share knowledge (Source: Slide 3, Week 2 Lecture, "slides on content, content, and mission, and content models").

In My Own Words:
I think content is any information that someone produces and refines to share with others. Itâ€™s engaging or informative, often reflecting the creator's perspective.

Real-life Example: 
TechCrunch is a blog that covers tech news and startups. TechCrunch Homepage. Its editors deliver timely, structured information to its readers. It highlights content as information designed to inform and engage its audience.
