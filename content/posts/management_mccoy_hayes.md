"A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, 
organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content."

## What Is Content Management To Me?

To me, content management is the way that content is planned, organized, structured, edited, and delivered.
Content management, essentially, is just managing content.

## What Is An Example Of This?

An example that I thought of when thinking about content management was YouTube.
The process of running a YouTube channel follows all of the practices of content 
management defined by Deane Barker. The specific YouTube channel that I thought of was
is the channel Good Mythical Morning.

I have watched their videos for a long time, and they really help show how big of
a team goes into running a YouTube channel. They have a large staff that is separated into different groups and subgroups
that help to run the channel. These teams help to both plan the channel's content and 
bring these plans to life. Besides the planning and team work that goes into running this channel, their channel page also follows content 
management. The page is well organized, this is important for large YouTube
channels as it helps viewers navigate your channel, and you can highlight things that
you want your viewer to see. They have playlists that seperate videos by seasons, topics, video types, etc. When 
I am eating, I like to watch their frozen vs. fast vs. fancy videos, so I can easily
find a playlist of these videos here and watch one.
