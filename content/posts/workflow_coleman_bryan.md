When looking at the **different phases** a task should move through before it is complete, I believe it can primarily broken down as we can begin by defining the problem and the objectives along with it. Next, we should plan out the schedule and see if certain aspects need to be done by a certain deadline. Next, any minor background research that needs to be done before completing the task can occur, and then they will actually carry out the task and fix it. After that, it would be useful to minored the changes and almost test it to make sure it works as intended. To conclude this process, we should end by getting feedback to see if we could improve our work next time. Additionally, when looking at the different roles people in the class should take on, I believe it would most effective to do a mix of both permanent jobs as well as on the fly changes. When it comes to permanent jobs, I believe having an overall project manager to oversee everything would be very effective for keeping everyone on task. However, I believe most tasks should be completed by those most educated on those specific subjects or if an individual has a desire to take it. In other words, let every individual play to their strengths and around their weaknesses. In other words, we can change the editors, site planners, developers, and administrators as we need to.
