According to Deane Barker User-Generated Content is, **"Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website.""**
	
To me, User-Generated Content is content made by everyday people that is shared on websites and different types of social media platforms for the consumption of everyone. These could be youtube videos or even images.

An example I have in mind is a video about [someones favorite video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boa0B3cmYXg&ab_channel=Aztecross)

This example illustrates the concept I am writing about because it is content made from an everyday person for other people to consume the information of the content.
