## Definition
'A wide-ranging term that generally rerfers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing and delivering content'- Deane Barker

## My own words
Content management is the organization of content in regards to its particular users and specific practices.

## Example
Reddit is a content management system that allows users to contribute to what they call "communities" and organizes their posts to those specific threads. Links 'hot' topics and recommends other communities to authors/users that may be interested.
