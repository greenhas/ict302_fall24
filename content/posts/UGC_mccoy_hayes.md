## What is User-Generated Content to Me?

To me, user-generated content is content that is published on a website by users of 
the website.

## What is an Example of This?

The first example that comes to my mind when I hear user-generated content
is Wikipedia. Here is the link to their website: https://www.wikipedia.org/ 


It is even quoted on their website:

---

"Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia, is one of the largest user-generated content databases in the world."
> Wikimedia Foundation. (2024, August 25). User-generated content. Wikipedia. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content#:~:text=Wikipedia%2C%20a%20free%20encyclopedia%2C%20is,content%20databases%20in%20the%20world.

Wikipedia is an example of user-generated content because people who use Wikipedia
can create and edit the content on the website. I have been able to create and published
content on Wikipedia myself. Wikipedia does not have a set group of people who 
creates content for them; content posts are largely ran by the community.
