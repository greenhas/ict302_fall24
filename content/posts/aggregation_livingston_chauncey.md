## What is Content Aggregation?
To me, content aggregation is simple; it's just the organization of content. Deane Barker -someone who knows a lot more than me- describes it as
*An intentional grouping of content for organization or presentation.*
A straightforward definition, but content aggregation can get somewhat complex.

## How is it used?
One of the more common examples of content aggregation is organizing things into categories or using tags. On platforms like Instagram, people can add hashtags that go with their posts to add them to other libraries of similar content. Not only does this help the person posting, but it makes it easier for people to find related information. A great example of this is
[Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com/) where almost all of the content is separated by tags and can be organized in hundreds of categories.
