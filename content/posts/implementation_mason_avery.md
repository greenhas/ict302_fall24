## Mission
Word press will be the actual working environment we will utilize. Here we will actually edit the project and implement our brainstormed, assigned tasks. MS Teams will be how we coordinate this project between groups. Propose ideas, assign work, strategize, and the main form of class communication.

## Expectations
Every team member will be responsible for their own share. Not one member should feel expected to do everything. Team members should be expected of contributing to the overall mission, regardless of their roles. If one is struggling they should be encouraged to reach out and ask for assistance while also provide assistance whenever possible. Checking teams (or any other communication app) on a regular basis and keep the lines of communication open. If everyone is focused on their selected tasks and providing/requesting help when needed, is how we will complete this project.
