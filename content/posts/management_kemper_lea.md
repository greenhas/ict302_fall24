Content management is an editorial process of creating, organizing, storing, and maintaining digital content, such as text, images, videos, and documents. The editorial process ensures that content is clear, accurate, engaging, and aligned with the intended goals. I am the content manager for the tattoo parlor I work at. So I deal with this on a daily basis. A good example of the editorial process is I will take 4 hours to make a 10-second video. A lot of editing goes into these videos for the final product to reach our audience.
