> ## **What is** *"Presentation"*

"Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it's shown" (Mauricio Harp). 

> ## **Presentation in my own words**

Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content

> ## **Presentation in Canvas**

[Canvas](https://uk.instructure.com/?login_success=1) has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students. Most college students do not want to work to hard to access cerrtain assignments or readings for classes. As soon as you login into Canavs you can change the way your main page looks by either Card view, List view, and Recent activity. This gives a way for the consumer to customize their own version of the site. Then on the left side are different tabs that can take you were you want to go.
