## content management definition
 is a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. *(Deane barker)*  [classes slides](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/_302_2024_w6_c1.html#57)
 . In my own word, content management is all about organizing, storing, and sharing information and media (like text, images, and videos) in a way that makes it easy for people to access and use. This can involve using tools and software to create, edit, and publish content on websites or social media. Essentially, it's about making sure the right content gets to the right people at the right time!
 ### Real-Life Example

A great example of content management in action is [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that uses content management systems to organize vast amounts of information.

### How This Example Illustrates Content Management

Wikipedia illustrates content management perfectly because it allows users to easily navigate a massive database of articles. Each entry is systematically organized, edited for accuracy, and updated regularly. The platform's use of categories, links, and tags makes it easy for users to find related content. This demonstrates how effective content management can enhance user experience and accessibility.
