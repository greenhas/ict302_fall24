## Workflow Description

First, we will post the required tasks to Microsoft Teams, moving them into the "Brainstorming" section on Teams first. Once the tasks have been brainstormed, they will be assigned to the relevant teams for drafting. Once the groups have drafted their work, the assigned project manager people will look it over and then show it to Dr. Greenhalgh for final feedback. If feedback is made, it will be fixed by the editors or designers before being finalized and actually implemented on the website. 

## Class Expectations and Workload

I feel like communication in this class is very important. Perhaps the groups should utilize some sort of group messaging platform, like GroupMe, for discussing what they're working on outside of class. This should allow for people to communicate with each other and let each other know what they're working on when we don't meet as a class. Perhaps there should also be some system for checking in with Dr. Greenhalgh on individual progress, so the groups can be sure that one or two people aren't doing all the work while everybody else is slacking off. Different tasks can also be assigned to members of each group within Teams, and people can be held accountable for this work as well.
