## Tasks phases

Assuming we utilize Microsoft teams and with the introduction of the "Bucket-System" Dr. Greenhalgh showcased. I propose we split the tasks sections into 5-6 buckets.
1st Bucket - General idea, or initial thought of something
2nd Bucket - Planning stage
3rd Bucket - assignment stage (delegating task to who should be responsible)
4th Bucket - Finished state (task is finished and ready to be integrated)
5th Bucket - Revision stage (review work for potential errors)
6th Bucket - Completed tab (to track what has been fully developed and finished)

## Potential Roles
Project manager - tasked with making and overseeing all projects and tasks and account for time management, prioritize tasks in a chronological order.

Editor - Tasked in charge of the 5th bucket "revision" ensuring all potential errors/conflicts are not overlooked.

Developer(s) - Tasked with general tasks particularly in the 3rd and 4th buckets. 

Project planner(s) - Tasked with the brainstorming of ideas, tasks and content.

Presentation developer(s) - Tasked with the overall presentation theme of our finished product. Where "x should be etc." Should focus on things such as themes. Overall in charge of the visuals.

Team leads - Tasked with overseeing each department Presentation, Developers, Planners, and editors and reports directly to the Project manager.
