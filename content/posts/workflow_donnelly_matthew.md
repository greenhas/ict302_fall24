**Workflow 

**Phases
1. Brainstorming - Think of ideas on what we actually need to change in the website
2. Planning - Make a simple plan on how to execute these changes
3. Devolop - Devolop these changes on the backend 
4. Test - Test to make sure these changes are working properly 
5. Review - Review the changes and make sure there are no mistakes 
6. Publish - Finally, we can publish our work after everything has been peer-reviewed

**Roles
First I think that there should be different groups for different parts of the website. 
Within these groups, there should be backend devolopers, editors, planners, and publishers
People that are comfortable with devoloping/coding could implement the changes on the website
Editors can make sure there are no mistakes 
Planners can make a coherent plan so that it is easy to follow
I feel like everybody could be publishers.
