## What is Presentation? 

In *Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content*, author Deane Barker defines presentation as "the use of colors, fonts, etc." on a website that changes the way the content looks (Barker, 2013). 

In other words, this means that presentation is the way that the content looks when a user visits a website. The presentation can include the font that the content is set in, the size of the font, the color of the background, and many other general visual attributes of the website. From my own personal experience, I know that the content can even be changed by the user. In short, presentation is just how the website looks to the visitor. 
## User-Generated Content Example

An example of presentation would be any website that has the option to change the display to a "Dark Mode", "Dark Theme", "Light Mode". For the purposes of this, I'll use the website [Twitter](https://x.com/home). Well, I guess it's technically called X now. I think also they make you log in to see anything, but I'm going to assume that we all know how Twitter (X) works. 

For this example, Twitter (X) has the option to change the display theme between dark and light. It defaults to dark, but it can be changed to light if the user prefers. The ability to change the theme of a website between dark and light mode is an example of presentation because the user is changing the way that the content is displayed on the website. When the theme is changed between light and dark, the entire way of displaying the site also changes.
