## Definition

A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content (Baker,2016).

## In my own words 
In simpler terms, content management is the system behind organizing and managing information, like text, images, or videos, that you see on websites. Instead of manually coding or handling files, a **Content Management System (CMS)** does the work of keeping everything organized and ready for use.

## Example 
one example for contant management is **Youtube** [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).Creators can upload, organize, and categorize videos into playlists or channels, just like how CMS platforms manage different types of content. Creators can also manage monetization options giving them control over how their content generates revenue.
