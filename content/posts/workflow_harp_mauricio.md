For our GMS class project, a content management workflow that follows several phases to ensure tasks are completed. First, the project manager assigns tasks based on the team's needs. The content creator develops the content. Once completed, the content moves into the review phase, where another team member checks for accuracy and alignment with project goals. An editor refines the content, ensuring it is ready for submission. The final approvers does one last check before the content is published or submitted. 
Roles -  Project manager (who oversees tasks and timelines), Content creators, Reviewers, Editors, Final approvers, and Tech support (for managing technical issues related to publishing)
