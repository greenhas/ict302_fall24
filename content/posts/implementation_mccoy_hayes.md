# Implementing Workflows

## WordPress

- We will use WordPress for our content management

- Allows us to keep an eye on revision history and check what has been done and what needs
to be changed

- You can leave comments on pages to provide feedback for these pages

- There are so many plugins we can use to help implement a workflow, whether for collaboration, task management, automation, calandars, and 
more

---

## Teams

- We can use Teams to communicate with each other and to collaborate

- We can use Teams to share files and documents

- We will use our Teams tasks along with our workflow for assigning and completing tasks

- We can use the calendar function for deadlines and important events regarding the project

---

## Others?

- I think that it would be helpful to have a documentation workflow, such as a shared Google Doc or Word Online document for another place for project managers
to document information. I do not know of any better free solutions for this.
