**Definition**: "A CMS is a software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and utimately delvering content" (Barker, 2024)

**Explanation in own words**: I think content management system is a software tool that helps users manage digital content without needing to write code. It allows people to easily create, organize, edit, and publish website content.

**Real-life example**: [Apple News](https://www.apple.com/apple-news/) is a prime example of a content management system in action. It aggregates articles from various publishers and presents them in a seamless, curated feed for users. Editors and content creators submit their articles to Apple News, and the system organizes, filters, and delivers content based on user preferences and topics.

**How it Illustrates the Concept**: Apple News demonstrates the CMS concept by managing vast amounts of content and delivering it in a personalized format. It automates gathering and organizing articles from multiple sources while its editorial team ensures high-quality content.
