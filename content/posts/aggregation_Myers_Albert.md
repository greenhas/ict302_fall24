> ## **What is** *"Content aggregation"*

Content agreegation is, "An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation" (Deane Barker). 

> ## **Content aggregation in my own words**
Makes it easier to find specific content on the sites UI. 

> ## **Content aggregation on TikTok**
Tiktok for instance has a for you page (FYP) section and a following section. This gives the user the freedom to choose between fresh content from someone they don't follow or to watch new relased content from someone they follow. This seperates the content by a specific group and makes it easier for a user to navigate.
