### Presentation

"content is the raw data, while presentation is how it's shown" Mauricio Harp

## What is presentation to me in regards to content

To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

## example I chose

A source of content I regularly consume is my YouTube feed. On the main webpage of YouTube if you are signed in and browse the site frequently you will be 'presented' with multiple different videos specifically tuned to your taste. Visually on the left are tabs that showcase "shorts, subscriptions, history liked videos etc." In the center of the screen is all videos based on your previously watched content.
