We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to **implement our workflow** by instilling a process of steps to help implement workflow. Primarily, WordPress can be used for content management as we can use this program to put each student in their chosen roles, such as an editor or project manager. We can then utilize Teams to help create communication lines between the various groups and roles as well as creating deadlines for when we need assignments completed by. These processes can help create a seamless workflow that enhances productivity and collaboration.

When looking at reasonable expectations for how class members will use those technologies to communicate and report on their workflow actions, this can be accomplished by using Teams to communicate, such as updating the overall class and specifically tasked groups about deadlines and assignments. Additionally, we can use these resources to give feedback to fellow classmates regarding their work and timeline factor.
