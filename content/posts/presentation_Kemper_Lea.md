Content presentation is how information (or content) is structured, displayed, and formatted for users in various mediums, such as websites, apps, or printed materials. Focusing on the visual aspects of the content delivery such as design, typography, organization, interactive elements, and media inclusion/placement. Basically how information is shown to you, whether on a website, in an app, or print. A good example of presentation in my everyday use is the dark mode feature on Instagram/Facebook.[my link](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/?ref=app_tab) With the quick change of a setting, I can make the content more aesthetically easy to consume. Dark mode can also reduce brightness and glare serving as a more comfortable viewing option. In light or dark mode, the text, images, and videos remain identical showing a distinction between content and presentation.
