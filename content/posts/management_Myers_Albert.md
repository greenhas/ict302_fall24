> ## **What is** *"Content Management"*

Content managemnt, according to Deane Barker is, "a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content."

> ## **Content Management in my own words**

To me I think content management is the content is organized for the consumer to see in a certain way. You could easily just put out unorganized content. However, people probably won't want to view it, if there is no fluid motion of your content.

However, the moment you click on your own profile, the site seems very empty and simplistic. It helps get rid of a lot of clutter on the screen when you navigate around the site.
