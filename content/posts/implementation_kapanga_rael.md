## Implementing Our Workflow with WordPress
### How We’ll Use WordPress

WordPress is going to be our main platform for writing, editing, and publishing content. Here’s what that looks like:

1. **Writing Posts**: Each of us will create our posts in WordPress and save them as drafts until they’re ready for review. We'll use tags and categories to keep everything neat and easy to find.
   
2. **Reviewing Content**: Before anything goes live, posts will go through a review process. Editors will use WordPress to leave comments and approve or request changes. This keeps everything clear and organized.
   
3. **Publishing**: Once the post is approved, we’ll publish it on our class blog. We can also schedule posts ahead of time to make sure we stay on track with our deadlines.

### How We’ll Use Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams will be where we communicate and stay updated. Here’s how it fits into our workflow:

1. **Assigning Tasks and Giving Updates**: Tasks will be assigned in Teams, and everyone is expected to keep the group updated on what they’re working on in the relevant Teams channel.
   
2. **Asking Questions and Getting Feedback**: If you’re stuck or need feedback, Teams is where you should ask for help. It’s a quick way to get answers and keep things moving.
   
3. **Weekly Check-ins**: We’ll have a weekly meeting in Teams to review how things are going and address any issues that come up.

### Other Tools We’ll Use

Aside from WordPress and Teams, we might also use:
- **Google Drive** for sharing documents, images, or research.
- **Grammarly** for proofreading before submitting posts.

### Expectations for Everyone

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep the group posted on your progress by updating Teams. For example, once you’ve finished a draft in WordPress, let everyone know.
   
2. **Quick Responses**: If you get feedback or requests for changes, respond quickly so we can stay on schedule.

3. **Help Each Other Out**: If someone’s stuck or behind, step in and offer support when you can.

4. **Keep Quality in Mind**: Before submitting a post for review, use tools like Grammarly or WordPress’s preview to make sure everything looks good and reads well.
