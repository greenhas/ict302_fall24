## What is User-Generated Content?


According to Deane Barker, "Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website." 

Barker, D.(2016). [Web Content Management](https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/user-generated-content/). O'Reilly Media


## To my Understanding


User generated content is something that is created by non professionals and usually shows the real/raw identity of something without getting paid.


## Example


An example of user generated content is reviews for a Amazon product. Here is an example ->
[Amazon Review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T29DPZDMA2FX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ37B73B)


This is example of user generate content. The user left a honest 4 star review. Something that the brand did not pay the user to do. Usually a brand would pay for 5 star reviews. However in Amazon, companys cannot pay a user to leave a 5 star review, that would be consider buying reviews and thus illegal. Anyways the user left a honest 4 star review, explained why, and it's within moderation. The buyer doesnt seem to be paid, doesnt look like a professional bed frame reviewer nor product reviewer and only show the real feelng towards the item.
