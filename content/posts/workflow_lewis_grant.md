When creating a workflow, the main focus is fixing an issue or problem or working towards a specific goal. By determining our goal first, we can build a fine-tuned system towards our goal.

Setting clear deadlines and determining the sequence of tasks is crucial. This ensures that each part of the project is completed on time. If one team or group falls behind, it could potentially disrupt the entire project. 

Once we do that, we should have regular checkups or frequently update others verbally or via a collaboration platform so others can stay updated and be upheld to their contribution.

Once we are confident, it is best to test or see the rough draft to get an idea of any improvements that might want to be made. This should be done by multiple inputs, such as other employees (classmates) and outside users. With different inputs, we ensure that our product. (website) can be used by almost anyone. 

When also reviewing, ensure that all information is correct to ensure the reliability of the website. 

Repeat fixing and getting input until we are confident about our product. 
Have a final lookover and publish.

Beyond the workflow, we should also review regularly to ensure the website functions as intended, and that information is still relevant and factually correct.
