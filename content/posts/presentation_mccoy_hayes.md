## What is Presentation To Me?

To me, presentation is how content is displayed. It is what you see when you go
to a webpage or an application, and it is anything with a graphical user interface.

## Examples?

One example of presenstation that came to my mine was the University of Kentucky's website.

Here is the link to the website: https://www.uky.edu/!

## University of Kentucky's Website Presentation

I think that the University of Kentucky's website is a good example of
presentation because of its purpose to display school pride and stand out from
other schools. If someone had not visited UK's campus before and they are just
checking out the website to decide if they wanted to go there, it is imporant
for the website to have a good presentation. The website follows a theme with the 
school colors and displays images that make it look like a fun and great place to
go to. If the presentation was boring or not relevant to UK, then it would not be
appealing to someone going to the site, and it might influence someone's decision to
come to the school or work for the school. Presentation is very imporant when you
are trying to stand out from your competitors, and it is imporant in making a good
image for yourself.
