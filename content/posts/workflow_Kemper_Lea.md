For our GMS class project to ensure that the task is completed properly we must break it into workflow phases such as planning, executing, and reviewing. In the planning stage, we will define our task and objectives outlining what "completion" of our website will look like. Delegation of tasks is also a part of the planning phase. Execution is actual work on the task to ensure that we are on track and identify any issues. In the reviewing stage any necessary revisions or adjustments based on the peer review and feedback. We compare our planning to see if we have hit all of the objectives then the task is complete.  To delegate workload the Planners and Editors (6-7 people) should be the same people, that way they can envision the project and be the ones at the end to revise the draft. We should have 7-10 individuals working on the body of information. A group of 3-4 working on the presentation of our site. We should have leaders of each subgroup speak on behalf of the group for update meetings.
