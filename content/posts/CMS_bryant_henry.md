## What is a Content Management System? 

In *Web Content Management*, author Deane Barker defines a content management system (CMS) as a "software system that automates the tasks around the management of content". CMSs help content editors with "controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content" (Barker, 2016). 

In other words, this means that a content management system is a technology that allows a webmaster, website creator, or website administrator to create content and display it to users. CMSs make it so a user doesn't have to follow many steps, they just have to use the CMS, and content can be created and deployed automatically. 
## Content Management Example

An example of a content management system would be WordPress, linked [here](https://wordpress.com/). 

WordPress is perhaps one of the most famous examples of content management systems, and many websites on the internet use it. WordPress is the perfect example of a content management system because it allows for users with minimal programming experience to create and manage websites. The user just has to do some of the initial work and create the content itself, and WordPress does all the heavy lifting beyond that. WordPress is responsible for the display of the content as well as the control and security of it. Again, the user just has to create the content and get it into WordPress, WordPress does the rest, making it very easy for those without much programming knowledge or experience.
