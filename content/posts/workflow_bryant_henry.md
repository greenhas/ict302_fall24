## Different Phases

There are several different phases that a task should pass through before it is marked complete. First, the task should be brainstormed; we should actually think about what we want to work on with the site. The brainstorming step would also include assigning someone to work on the post. Next, once the task has been brainstormed, we need to actually draft the task - we need to fix the site in whatever way we brainstormed about. Then, someone should look over the fix and make sure that it meets what was discussed in the brainstorming and publish it if it meets these outlines. Finally, the task can be implemented, or published to the site, or displayed, or whatever. 

## Class Roles

There are several roles that would be beneficial for different people in our class to take on. First, there could be dedicated "editors" - people who's main role it is to edit the content that we as a class have decided is worthy of editing on the site. These could be permanent editors, or they could just be people who notice something and want to edit it. We could also have people who act as proofreaders; people who check the edits. Then, there could be people who are specifically tasked with posting the edits and actually making changes to the site. We could also have people who are responsible for noticing issues with the site to tell the editors what to fix. I don't think it's a good idea to have many students be in charge of administration or major deletion - any large work should probably be left to Dr. Greenhalgh.
