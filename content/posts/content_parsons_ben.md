According to Dr. Barker, **"Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication."** Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media.

For me, I believe that content is **something that is meant to entertain other people, inform people, and or help people. It is also something that is created by humans for humans.**

An example of a piece of content is a [how to youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXaLc9AYIcg&ab_channel=TechSource)
This ties to my definition because this video is a video that is made by a person for someone to learn something new.
