According to Deane Barker content management is, **""A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.""**

Content managment to me means, the management of man made entertainment, information, etc that is meant to be consumed by humans.

An example of content management is a [Wix template](https://www.wix.com/)

This is a good example of content management because you are able to manage information and have it organized using a website template from Wix.
