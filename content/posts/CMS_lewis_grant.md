â€œA software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content." (Barker, 2016) 

This definition means that a service allows users to organize their content without interacting with them, but it also allows customization to satisfy the user if needed. This reminds me of Apple Photos as it takes the photos I have taken or imported and can self-organize them using meta-data. The Photos app will also self-make highlight reels, past trips, or topics such as family, location, date, etc. It also allows me to share, sort, and edit all my photos in folders, shared folders, and tags.
