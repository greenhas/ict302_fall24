**In My Own Words**


To my understanding, content management is something a human do make sure what they're publishing is understandable to other humans.


## Content Management Example


An exmaple of content is news articles. News article is something a human has to create, organize, review, approve, published, and finally deliver to the public. This is a news article about hurricane Helene, a human was there to capture the pictures, then most likely a different human created and edited the post, then got approved, then published. Finally other people can see the news. The site is managing the content for all of the news articles.
