What is Content Aggregation?

"An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation" Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media


I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It's the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?

The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed. Youtube will organize other content based of your subscriptions, watched, liked or disliked videos. Thus presenting you with options they believe you may like.
