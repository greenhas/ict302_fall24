## User generated content

"Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website" 

Barker, D. (n.d.). *User-generated content*. Deane Barker. https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/user-generated-content/

To me User generated content are things in which users of a particular platform post/create. 

Sources of content I regularly consume are that of Twitter, Reddit and various internet forums. In these platforms users are creating posts and actively contributing to discussions and or creating content themselves. 

## Ex:
https://www.reddit.com/

Here is the homepage of reddit where users can search for communities and contribute to the communities page: ask questions, offer insight or post any sort of content.
