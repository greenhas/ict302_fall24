Getting the essentials out the way, like assigning roles and tasks before we begin a project. 
We'll then need to make sure we document what we do, like when we complete a task. 
Completed tasks will be reviewed and sent back with suggestions if needed and it'll keep happening when complete
When all tasks are done, there will be one final review and once settled, the project is done and sent over 

Reasonable expectations are communication and transparencey. We'll need to communicate any issue to make sure things go smoothly.
