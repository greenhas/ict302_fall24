**User-generated content** is content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website. I got this definition from the class sides, which can be found [here.](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/_302_2024_w3_c1.html#14)
In my own words, user-generated content is any published type of information or media where a contributor or user provides that information as opposed to an editor.
One example I have for user-generated content is that I always read or look at customer reviews before I purchase anything online, such as from Amazon. I have included a link for a game, and at the bottom there are customer reviews from those who have spent time and money on that game, so they are always a genuine experience and reaction. They serve as user-generated content as the reviews are not posted from editors, but random users on the site with the product.
