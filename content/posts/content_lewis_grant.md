What is Content?

From what I have read and learned, content is visual or auditory information that can be used to share information or knowledge. The slides from week two from Baker are "intended for consumption by a human audience." I think of this as meaning data that has not been sculpted or formatted is not necessarily considered content but data. However, when curated, it becomes content or information that people can interact with. An example that I think of is music. I have been using my dad's iPod with some of his favorite songs. But if you think about it is just a bunch of music files. However, when given the correct name for each song, the artist, and album artwork and organized by genre, it provides a new experience and interacts in a new way.
