WordPress will be our CMS, and we will use it to manage our content, from creating and managing posts and themes to ensuring the website is consistent and that information is updated.  We will use teams to communicate and collaborate on our assigned parts and ensure others are doing their part. We also use teams to share files and task assignments. 
Using WordPress, we can see what people have done or changed. The same is true for teams, as transparency with progress and tasks will help in the long run.
