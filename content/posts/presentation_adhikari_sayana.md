**What is Presentation?**
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)

**In my words**

Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It's about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn't change the actual content itself.

**Example**

[NewsArticle](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/asheville-hurricane-helene-damage.html)
An example of presentation would be a news article. The content is the text, images, and videos in the article, but the presentation is how that content appears: the size and style of the headlines, the placement of images, the background color of the webpage, and whether the text is left-aligned or centered. The same article might have a different presentation on a mobile app, where the text is larger and the images are resized to fit the smaller screen.
