## Definition
Presentation in content aggregation refers to how aggregated information is structured and displayed to ensure usability and clarity for the end user.

## Explanation  
This concept involves formatting and organizing aggregated content to make it engaging and easy to navigate, often through tools like dashboards, visuals, or categorization.

## Example 
[Google News](https://news.google.com) aggregates headlines from multiple sources, categorizes them by topic or location, and presents them in a simple, scrollable format with visuals and clickable headlines.

## How the Example Illustrates the Concept
Google News exemplifies content presentation by providing a clean, organized display of aggregated information, making it easy for users to access relevant news with minimal effort.
