## What is Content Management System?


According to Deane Barker, "A software system which autmates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content." 

Barker, D.(2016). [Web Content Management Glossary](https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/content-management-system/) O'Reilly Media


## To my Understanding


Content management system is a platform that holds the content that people are publicly seeing. Its a easier way for people who dont know how to code to show their content on the web.


## Example


An example of content management system is Shopify. Here is an example ->
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)


This is example of content management system. It's a platform that is made for people who can't code a entire website. Shopify make it to where users can create a website using their already coded "blocks". Users can just add a "block" and update the pictures/information to their liking in a very simple way. This action requires no coding for the user and allows user to show their content in a very simple way
