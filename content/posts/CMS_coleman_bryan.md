A **content management system (CMS)** is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for technical knowledge. I got the definition from [here](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/).
 In my own words, a content management system is software that can help a user when it comes to creating and publishing any type of content. 
For my example, I think Wix serves as a great content management system as it helps a user create, manage, and publish content.
