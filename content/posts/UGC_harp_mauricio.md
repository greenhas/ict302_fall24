Definition of UGC
User-generated content refers to "content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website" (Source: user-generated content and CMS extensions slide 14, Week 3). 
In my own words
I think UGC is content made by everyday users, like posts and reviews shared on platforms. 
Real-life Example: Reddit
Reddit is a prime example of UGC. Users submit posts, links, and discussions across different communities. For instance, in 
[r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/?rdt=44277)
, users can share and discuss tech news, showing how the platform relies on user-generated content.
