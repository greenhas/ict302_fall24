## What is Presentation and what does it look like?
Usually associated with [content](https://ict302fall24.netlify.app/posts/content_livingston_chauncey/), but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple's new [ios 18](https://medium.com/@GuillemBruix/design-your-dark-and-tinted-versions-of-your-app-icon-for-ios-18-827444a31851) where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.
