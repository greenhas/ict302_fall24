**Presentation** refers to the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on various medias and devices to provide a specific experience for the user. The source for my definition can be found (here)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/presentation-content#:~:text=Presentation%20content%20refers%20to%20the,provide%20a%20consistent%20user%20experience.].
In my own words, presentation refers to the various aspects designed to help display content to the user. This can be achieved through both visual and information elements. 
One example of this concept of presentation is a YouTube video by Bryson DeChambeau. Within the video we see this concept of presentation as he make sure his voice is heard clearly through the use of microphones, and he makes sure there is good lighting and the recording looks good, so that the video is good quality, well perceived, and attractive to the audience. Lastly, he also tracks the golf balls he hits with a red line so the audience can see and better follow along. These aspects all help lead to a good presentation factor in his videos.
