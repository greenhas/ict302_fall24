Content is "... information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication." Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media. To me, this means content that is produced by humans for human interaction. 

Some content I regularly consume are YouTube videos(youtube.com). This aligns with the definitions because the videos are content that has been created by a human, edited, and then made for human consumption.
