## What is Content?
Formally "Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication."
*Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O'Reilly Media*
In my opinion content is various types of information or media shared on any type of platform. For example [here](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=camaro%20zl1&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fhips.hearstapps.com%2Fhmg-prod%2Fimages%2F2024-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-collectors-edition-647e05de95705.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caranddriver.com%2Fchevrolet%2Fcamaro-zl1&docid=tgcg5TloakjEwM&tbnid=sQ-ppBFeGNAQJM&vet=12ahUKEwiPzLHJtLeIAxXHrYkEHeUEB8MQM3oECBoQAA..i&w=5000&h=3329&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwiPzLHJtLeIAxXHrYkEHeUEB8MQM3oECBoQAA) is a website that has multiple types of content including an article and pictures.
