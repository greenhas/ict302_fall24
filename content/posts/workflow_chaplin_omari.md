## Content Management Proposal

**Well, its that part of the semester!**

When thinking about the workflow for our blog, we'll have to consider an approach that has as little friction as possible as we make decisions on how we complete tasks.

  
- **Task/Prompt**

Find out what our task is, based on instructions and vision for the blog.

- **Idea Formation and Brainstorming**

With a task/prompt in mind, we can begin to think about ideas of what we want to post. This step may be fairly quick or automatic depending on the complexity of the task/prompt. *It's critical that we find an objective to follow in our next step.*

  

- **Execution/Rough Draft**

  

After knowing our task/prompt and having an objective in mind, we can begin to put our thoughts into reality and work on our rough draft of our post.

  

- **Review and Edit Changes**

  

After completing our rough draft, we'll have to review and preview our work, and then make appropriate edits based on our observations. Different editors or someone who works on the front end may have to approve of the draft and recommend changes. Taking these suggestions and edits into consideration, we can now move on to our final version of our post!

  

- **Approval and Final Submission**

  

After an administrator approves the final version of our post, not sending it back to the editors or making minor changes themselves, the final draft will be posted to the live site! Additional monitoring may be needed to make sure everything looks good and meets our quality of standards.

  

- **Complete!**

  

## Different Roles for Our Class

Given that we aren't professionals and we're all busy with many other tasks (college), let's try to keep the roles fairly simple and condensed to remove friction and make it as easy as possible, but still effective in our goal: **get stuff done (efficiently).**

  

Therefore, a rough list of roles could be:

  

- **Site Builder** - Ensures the website layout matches our needs

- **Content Editor** - Creates content for the website

- **Content Editor** - Proofreads an edits content for the website

- **Administrator** - Handles tagging, approval, and making last-minute adjustments
