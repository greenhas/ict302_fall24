**Presentation** is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to [Barker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/presentation-content#:~:text=Presentation%20content%20refers%20to%20the,provide%20a%20consistent%20user%20experience.).

To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible

One example of presentation is on [UK's website](https://www.uky.edu/). What we see here is **the actual content of the page** presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing! Inspecting the page with right-click or F12 shows a whole host of information and code, but the user (without effort) will not see this.
