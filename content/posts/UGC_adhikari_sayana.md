**What is UGC?**

User-generated content (UGC) is published information that an unpaid contributor provides to a website. The information might be a photo, video, blog or discussion forum post, poll response or comment made through a social media website (Kinza Yasar, 2022). UGC can include:
Text,Photos,Videos,Audio,Reviews,Podcasts,Blog posts,Testimonials,Software, like video game mods.

**In my own words**

UGC stands for User-Generated Content. It includes photos, videos, post that are created by regular people post and not the companies on social media.

**Example**

For example of UGC we can take one of any social media out there.Instagram is one of them as we consume the content of photos, videos through that app which are made by us regular people.
