## What is Content Aggregation To Me?

Content aggregation is how content is organized or laid out so that it can be
viewed and navigated by users. 

---

## Examples?

An example that comes to mind for me is BuzzFeed.

Here is the link to their site: https://www.buzzfeed.com/!

I used to spend a decent amount of time scrolling through their site
to find fun quizzes and articles, and how they categorize their website made
it easy to find a lot of different content related to things I was looking for.

## BuzzFeed's Content Aggregation

BuzzFeed takes several different categories of content aggregation and puts them
together to make a easily navigatable website.

Their homepage displays what is trending on their site at
the moment. On the top of the page is a search bar where you can type in keywords and find related content.

There are also three lines that when clicked opens up a menu. Here you can see
several different categories and subcategories within this that you can click on. Whenever you click into a category, you see a list of tags that you can filter by
and also trending pieces of content related to that category. After getting into a category and selecting a tag, it then displays a list of content for you to 
scroll through.

I think that the way they use content aggregation is purposeful and it helps
to users to navigate their website in an effective way.
