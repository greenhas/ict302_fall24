## What is Content? 

"Definition of Content"
**Content** would be something that users create and is "intended for consumption by a human audience" (Barker, 2016)

**My Definition** would be technically anything can be content; however, it needs to have that editorial process and needs to be consumed by humans in the simplest of terms.

**Content** that I regularly *consume*

If I ever feel like some of my photos are lacking any substance, I usually check out this website [my link](https://eyecannndy.com/) 
The reason that this website is **content** is that this is made for a human audiences, for creatives that are looking to find inspiration or try and recreate a visual shot.
