## Introduction

In our GMS class project, we will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to implement and enforce the content management workflow. These tools offer flexibility and structure to manage content creation, collaboration, and communication effectively.

## Implementing the Workflow

### WordPress:
WordPress will be the central hub for publishing and organizing content. Each team member will have designated roles (e.g., author, editor) to control access and ensure the integrity of content. The revision history feature allows us to track changes and maintain accountability.

### Teams:
Microsoft Teams will facilitate real-time communication, file sharing, and task management. We can assign specific tasks using Teams Channels based on workflow phases, such as drafting, editing, and publishing. Teams also allows for quick feedback and decision-making through chat and video calls.

### Other Technologies:
For version control, we can integrate Google Docs for collaborative writing and commenting on drafts. Trello can be used to track project progress, assign tasks, and set deadlines.

## Expectations for Technology Usage

Expectations
- Communicate daily updates and task completions via Teams.
- Use WordPress to upload content only when all steps of the workflow are completed.
- Report any issues or delays in Teams to ensure accountability and transparency.
- Track progress on Trello and provide weekly reports to the project manager.

## Conclusion

By using these tools strategically, we can create a seamless content management system that promotes efficiency and collaboration throughout our GMS class project.
