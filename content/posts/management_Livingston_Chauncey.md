## What is it?
Content Management is referred to as 
*"A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content."
Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary.* In my opinion it just means that there is information that is being organized or controlled using an editorial method.

## What does it look like?
We see examples of content management every day, especially on social media. This [link](https://www.youtube.com/) to YouTube showcases multiple videos aka content and it is managed because it was engineered to display the content in a way that benefits the user.
