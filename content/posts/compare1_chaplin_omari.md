## Content Management Scenario 
One content management scenario I could find myself in is in my own business as a content creator. I have to deal with hundreds of video files and videos on demand that I have recorded over the past years. I would likely work mostly on my own with some help from an editor. Thinking about what I would want in a CMS, I would want something that would allow me to mass tag and title my works. If there's a specific length of video, I think it would be helpful for me to identify the longest videoes and prepare them for cutting and highlighting. I would also want something that would help me export onto other platforms. Being able to post live updates to my website would also be helpful.
 ## Compare Hugo and WordPress
When looking at Hugo, I could imagine it being useful to have a compository of my videoes that one could access as a sort of archive. This way, I could fufill my need of having my work on another platform.
Conversely, I could see myself using WordPress to reference my work. If I make a website that I direct people to, I can them redirect them to the compiled work and archives I made on Hugo. Perhaps I'd have a better time doing it in that way, due to the ease of use for WordPress. 
With both platforms, I could also focus more on the presentation on using templating to make it easier and present my content in a way that I want to, as mentioned Deane Barker's explanation of presentation[^1]!
