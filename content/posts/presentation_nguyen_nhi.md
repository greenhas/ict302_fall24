### Presentation
The definition of this concept is *"Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."* (Barker, 2016)


In other words, the explanation for this concept is *"The presentation refers to how content is visually framed and displayed but the content remains the same."*

## Example
One example I use is [Instagramâ€™s dark mode](https://www.instagram.com). Instagram allows users to change between a light mode and a dark mode, where the background switches to black, and fonts and icons adjust to maintain visibility.
