Use WordPress as a platform for publishing and managing content for the GMS class project. WordPress allows us to organize tasks and review posts for approval.
Microsoft Teams will serve as communication. Teams will be used to assign tasks and report on progress. Team members can update each other on the status, flag issues, and feedback on drafts before final submission.
Other technologies, like Google Docs, can be used to collaborate on drafts before moving content to WordPress for final publishing. Google Docs uses real-time editing, making the drafting and review process better.

**Expectations for Class Members**

Class members should check Teams for updates and task assignments. All workflow actions, like drafting, reviewing, and final approvals, should be reported in Teams to inform the group about the projectâ€™s progress. For content creation, we should use WordPress to publish final drafts. Any drafts or discussions should be handled in Google Docs before moving content to WordPress for review and publishing.
