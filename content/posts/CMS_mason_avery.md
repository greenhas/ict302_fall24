## Definition
"A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content." - Deane Barker

## My own words
Content management systems or software are tools editors use to minimize the workload of content delivery and appearance.

## Example
One real life example that I consume daily would be Google drive. Google drive allows users to create either slides, word documents or sheets. These documents are then stored, organized and presented for later use. https://workspace.google.com/products/drive/
