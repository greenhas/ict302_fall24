## Phases a Task Should Pass Through

Before any piece of content gets published, it should be throughly 
gone over until it is determined complete. Below is an idea of my on how
we could structure these phases:

1. Planning Phase
	- We need to define our goals.
	- We need to get input from our peers and client.
	- We need to see what we have to work with, and overview what is already there.
1. Designing Phase
	- We need to create basic layouts of our ideas.
	- We need to plan out the structure of the task.
	- We need to agree on design elements and things like colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
1. Development Phase
	- We need to gather and transfer information from the old site to the new one.
	- We need to focus on the front-end and back-end development related to the task.
	- We need to make sure that everything works as intended.
1. Testing Phase
	- We need to test to make sure the completed task is functional.
	- We need to make changes based on test findings.
1. Review Phase
	- We need to review what we have done with our peers and decide if we need to change anything.
	- We need to review with our professor and implement any changes that are suggested.
1. Task Implementation Phase
	- If the task successfully completes all prior tasks and is approved then the task should be implemented and considered complete.
1. Continuous Editing Phase
	- If for some reason a task is affected by another task or something changes where the task needs implemented differently,
	the task should be changed accordingly.

## Roles to Consider

There are many different roles that come into play when designing a website. For our class,
I have come up with some roles to consider for people to take on during this project.

1. Front-End Designers
	- People in this role will design the presentation of the website.
1. Back-End Designers
	- People in this role will design the back end development of the website, more related to coding and functionality. 
1. Content Creators/Editors
	- These people will help to create and edit content for the website, they can transfer old content or create new.
1. Testers
	- These people can test the websites functionality and come up with ideas on how to implement issues they found.
1. Researchers
	- These people can do research on things to implement, content to add, and other relevant information.
1. Presenters
	- These people can present the updates to the website and be in change of showing other teams what has been done on their ends.
1. Record Keepers
	- These people can keep track of changes and updates to the website. 
1. Project Managers
	- These people can make sure everyone is doing their job and that work is getting done.
