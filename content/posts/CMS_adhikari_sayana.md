**What is CMS?**

"A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content."

**In my own words**

A Content Management System is software that helps you easily create and manage website content without needing to know how to code. It provides tools for writing, editing, and organizing content, as well as controlling how the website looks.

**Example**

An example of a CMS is WordPress.WordPress is a CMS because it lets you easily create and manage a website without knowing how to code. You can write and edit content, upload images, and organize everything. WordPress also allows you to change the look of your site using themes, and you can add extra features with plugins, all without affecting the content.
