**What is 'content aggregation'?**

An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation. (Dean Barker, Web Content Management Glossary)

**In my own words**

Content aggregation means gathering information from different places and putting it all together in one spot. It helps people find everything they need, like news or articles, without going to many different websites. 

**Example**

Example of content aggregation is YouTube. YouTube aggregates videos from countless creators and channels, allowing users to discover and watch a wide variety of content in one platform.

**How This Illustrates Content Aggregation:**

YouTube collects videos on everything from entertainment to education, showcasing content from different users and channels all in one place. Users can subscribe to their favorite channels and receive recommendations based on their viewing habits. This demonstrates content aggregation by curating diverse video content into a single platform, making it easy for viewers to find and explore new material without having to visit each creator separate site.
