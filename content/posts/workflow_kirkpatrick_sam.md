## Introduction

To keep our GMS project on track, it's important to have a simple workflow in place. In this proposal, I’ll outline the phases each task should go through before it’s considered complete, as well as suggest class roles that can help move tasks forward.

## Task Phases

Every task should begin with planning, where we define what needs to be done, assign roles, and set deadlines. Once the plan is clear, the assigned person begins drafting the content or completing the task. After the draft is finished, it moves to the review phase, where another classmate looks it over and provides feedback. Based on this feedback, revisions are made. Once the task is revised, it goes through finalization, where a last check is done to ensure everything is correct before publishing or marking the task complete.

## Class Roles

There are a few key roles we can use during this process. The project lead will be responsible for overseeing the workflow and making sure deadlines are met. The task owner will be responsible for carrying out the specific task assigned to them. A reviewer will step in to check drafts and provide suggestions. Finally, the publisher will make sure the final version is posted and ready for presentation or use.

## Conclusion

This simple workflow should help keep us organized and ensure tasks are completed efficiently. I look forward to discussing this proposal and hearing everyone’s feedback in class.
