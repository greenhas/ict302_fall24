## Definition 
Content aggregation is the process of collecting and organizing information from multiple sources into a single location for easier access and consumption. According to Rosenfeld and Morville (2002), "Content aggregation involves bringing together information from various sources to present it in a cohesive manner."

## Explanation
In simple terms, content aggregation is like curating information from across the web and organizing it for an audience. Instead of creating original content, aggregators collect and display content from other places, making it easy for users to find what they need.

## Example
[Flipboard](https://flipboard.com) is a great example of content aggregation. It gathers articles, blogs, and news from various publishers and organizes them into categories like technology, sports, and lifestyle for its users.

## How the Example Illustrates the Concept
Flipboard demonstrates content aggregation by collecting articles from different websites and presenting them in a magazine-like format. Users can personalize their experience by choosing topics of interest, which highlights the essence of aggregation: gathering and simplifying diverse content for easier consumption.
