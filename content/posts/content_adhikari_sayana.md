**Whai is Content?**

Content is a type of information that is made to engage, inform, or entertain the audience. Content can be in various formats such as text, images, videos, audio and any type of interactive elements.

**In my own words**

In my opinion content is something that we consume through digital platform. Watching some content and consuming entertainment plus some valuable information is a plus point cause you are not wasting your time but doing something mindful.

**Example**

[my link](https://www.youtube.com/@ericahaha) This youtube channel is something I relate with. Name of the conetnt creator is Erica Ha. She is a 20 year old youtuber who is succesful in her career and is going to college just like us people. She provides travelling, study, random vlog, type of content to educate her audience and I find them relatable. 

I watch her content because they are funny and relatable at the same time. Since, she is a Junior at University just like I am and has sister as well which is similar to my background and I find the content she provides relateable. Since she has some travelling videos, I plan to take notes from there while traveling. Since, content is some type of information that is made to engage, inform and entertain the audience, I find *Erica Ha*'s content entertainig and informational.
