## Definition
>" The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usaually through templating. A template apllied will result in output which is then delivered." -Deanne Barker, *web content management glossary

## In my own words 

Presentation is how content is adapted and displayed depending on the platform. This is done by applying templates that determine the structure and layout of the content. 

## Example 

**Canva**. Canva is an online tool for graphic design that helps users create different types of visual content. It offers templates for things like social media posts, presentations, and posters. For example, a template for a social media post will look different from a presentation slide, even if they have the same text or images. Canva makes it easy for users to adjust their content for different visual formats, ensuring that the design works well for each specific platform.
