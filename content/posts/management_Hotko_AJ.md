## Content Management Defined 
“A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.” (The Web Content Management Glossary, Barker 2016). 
## My Take on Content Management 
Content Management is the way that we generally organize our content in a manner in which is the most logical and efficient. 
## Example of Content Management
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/) would be an example of content management, you can create docs in which they are organized by date or name. Create your own documents putting content within them.
