**Definition** - The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered" (Barker, 2024)

**Explain in Your Own Word** - Presentation refers to how information is formatted and displayed using templates

**Example** - [Netflix] (https://www.netflix.com) presents the same movies, shows in different ways depending on your device, such as a smartphone, TV, or web browser. 

**How It Uses the Concept** - Netflix uses presentation by using templates to show how movies and shows are displayed. The content remains the same, but the layout changes to fit different screens, showing how it modifies content for specific shows or movies.
