## What is Content To Me?

Content is a term that can refer to a broad assortment of things

This can include 

+ Text
+ Visuals
+ Audios
+ Games
+ Lessons
+ And More!

For me content can be defined as a piece of information, entertainment, or
an experience that is created for the pupose to inform, entertain, or persuade, 
and this is consumed in a format that is either digital or physical.

## Examples?

The main source of content that I consume comes from TikTok.

## TikTok: Is It Content?

Lets take a look at the "broad assortment of things" I mentioned above and 
see how TikTok can also be defined by these.

| Category | :   | How Can TikTok Relate?  | 
|----------|-----|---------|
|--------- |     |         |
| Text     | :   |	When someone posts a TikTok they are able to post text along with the video,this text can be to inform, entertain, or persuade. Users can also comment on posts for the same reasons.	|
|--------- |     |         |
| Visuals  | :   |	This is the main focus of this platform. Users posts videos and these videos contain a broad amount of different forms of content.	|
|--------- |     |         |
| Audios   | :   |	Another aspect of TikTok is sounds and audios that people can use in their videos and also you can post videos with your own sounds and you can relay information or entertainment with audio.	|
|--------- |     |         |
| Games    | :   |	A feature that I was just recently introduced to is the games on TikTok. There are filters that can be played as games and then you can posts your attempts or your results.	|
|--------- |     |         |
| Lessons  | :   |	While much of TikTok is to pursuade or entertain, there is a large enviroment for learning, people post many different kinds of informational content that can be used to learn something new.	|
|--------- |     |         |
| Overall  | :   |	There are more aspects of content that I did not touch on, but overall TikTok provides users with a way to share their pieces of information, entertainment, or experience, so that they can inform, entertain, or persuade on a digital format. This to me is a prime example of content and fullfils the aspects of my definition.	|
