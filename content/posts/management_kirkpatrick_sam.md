## Definition
Content management is the process of creating, publishing, and managing digital content efficiently. It encompasses the strategies and tools that organizations use to organize and distribute content across various platforms. According to John Smith (2020), "Content management is the systematic administration of the information lifecycle from creation to archiving." John Smith wrote a book about understanding content management. 

## Explanation
Content management is about ensuring that information is readily available, organized, and up-to-date. It involves using various tools and methodologies to streamline the creation, editing, and publication processes, which ultimately improves the accessibility and usability of content for users.

## Real-Life Example
A great example of effective content management can be seen in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that allows users to create, edit, and manage content collaboratively. Each article undergoes constant updates and revisions from volunteers around the world, ensuring that the information is accurate and current.

This example illustrates the concept of content management as it showcases a platform that emphasizes community involvement in the content creation process. The structured system of editing and managing articles reflects the core principles of content management, where organization, collaboration, and continuous improvement are key to maintaining a reliable and valuable resource.
