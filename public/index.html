<p>This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders. This is executing intentional grouping of content. As for some of my trips, I purposefully group them in a file and can then sort by my rating, date, and location where I took the photos. You can get nit-picky in which you want to organize the images.</p>

<p>According to the slides and <em>Deane Barker</em>, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.</p>
<p>Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/?f=flair_name%3A%22Video%20Game%22">Liminal Spaces Subreddit</a>, I linked to the flairs that specified &ldquo;Video Games&rdquo;. Therefore, I can find posts easily that match that description!</p>

<p>&ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O&rsquo;Reilly Media</p>
<p>I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It&rsquo;s the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?</p>
<p>The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed. Youtube will organize other content based of your subscriptions, watched, liked or disliked videos. Thus presenting you with options they believe you may like.</p>

<p>In Deane Barker&rsquo;s words, content aggregation is, &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; (Barker).</p>
<p>##In my own words&hellip;</p>
<p>I would say that it really just makes it easier to find specific things on websites, since it uses grouping and organization.</p>
<p>##Examples?</p>
<p>First thing that comes to mind is Reddit. Reddit&rsquo;s home page is super simple and is easy to navigate for new users, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit Home Page</a> . If you are using reddit on the computer, on the left side there are topics that you can browse through. If you are interested in movies/tv you can just click on this topic ( which is a great example of content aggregation ).</p>

            <h2 id="what-is-content-aggregation">What is Content Aggregation?</h2>
<p>To me, content aggregation is simple; it&rsquo;s just the organization of content. Deane Barker -someone who knows a lot more than me- describes it as
<em>&ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for organization or presentation.&rdquo;</em>
A straightforward definition, but content aggregation can get somewhat complex.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-it-used">How is it used?</h2>
<p>One of the more common examples of content aggregation is organizing things into categories or using tags. On platforms like Instagram, people can add hashtags that go with their posts to add them to other libraries of similar content. Not only does this help the person posting, but it makes it easier for people to find related information. A great example of this is
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pintrest</a> where almost all of the content is separated by tags and can be organized in hundreds of categories.</p>

<h2 id="my-interpretation-of-content-aggregation">My Interpretation of Content Aggregation</h2>
<p>My interpretation of content aggregation is that It organizes content in a logical manner in which it is easier to consume</p>
<h2 id="example-of-content-aggregation---instagram">Example of Content Aggregation - Instagram</h2>
<p>A user can easily see content from creators in that they are following simply just by scrolling. On the bottom the screen the user has the options to make a post of their own, search for specific content, access an area in which they can see content posted by anyone even if they are not following them, and view their own profile. This style of content aggregation has everything organized in such a way that makes it very easy for the user to navigate.</p>

<p>Tiktok for instance has a for you page (FYP) section and a following section. This gives the user the freedom to choose between fresh content from someone they don&rsquo;t follow or to watch new relased content from someone they follow. This seperates the content by a specific group and makes it easier for a user to navigate.</p>

            <p><strong>Presentation</strong> refers to the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on various medias and devices to provide a specific experience for the user. The source for my definition can be found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/presentation-content#:~:text=Presentation%20content%20refers%20to%20the,provide%20a%20consistent%20user%20experience.">here</a>.
In my own words, presentation refers to the various aspects designed to help display content to the user. This can be achieved through both visual and information elements.
One example of this concept of presentation is a YouTube video by Bryson DeChambeau. Within the video we see this concept of presentation as he make sure his voice is heard clearly through the use of microphones, and he makes sure there is good lighting and the recording looks good, so that the video is good quality, well perceived, and attractive to the audience. Lastly, he also tracks the golf balls he hits with a red line so the audience can see and better follow along. These aspects all help lead to a good presentation factor in his videos. The source for my example can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUnIuodiOV4">here</a>.</p>
