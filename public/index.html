			Defining Content Management

		What is it? Content Management is referred to as &ldquo;A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.&rdquo; Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary. In my opinion it just means that there is information that is being organized or controlled using an editorial method.
What does it look like? We see examples of content management every day, especially on social media.

In my own words Presentation is how content is adapted and displayed depending on the platform. This is done by applying templates that determine the structure and layout of the content.
Example Canva. Canva is an online tool for graphic design that helps users create different types of visual content.

		Phases First, we will start by defining our project objectives so everyone understands what we want to accomplish. Then, we will break down the project into smaller tasks and assign them based on each person’s strengths. Then we should set deadlines to keep us on track and ensures timely completion. Once tasks are completed, we’ll compile drafts for review to get feddbacks from everyone.

		Task Phases I think there should be couple phases for the tasks starting with deciding what the task is and how indepth it will be. Next, we should decide which part of the website the task belongs to, is it part fo the main home page or is it part of an external link? Once that&rsquo;s figured out that will determine who it goes to and they can begin to work on it.

		content creation work flow:
Before starting to work on our class project, we should consider the following steps: Brain storming: This is where content ideas are brainstormed, aligned with overall goals, and scheduled. Content Creation: this is where we start creating content after brainstorming our ideas. Review &amp; Editing: after creating our content, we review the content for accuracy, grammar, and overall quality. Approval &amp; Final Review: after we have edited and review the content, we will have stakeholders take a look at the content for a final review and approve the content.

		Workflow Phases:
Plannig Phase: In this phase, the task is clearly defined. The goals, deadlines, and required deliverables are identified. Roles are assigned to classmates, and expectations are set.
Creating Phase: In this phase we produce the content itself, whether it&rsquo;s writing, designing visuals, or creating multimedia.
Reviewing Phase: After the content is created, it is passed to one or more reviewers for feedback. This phase ensures that the content is accurate, aligns with project goals, and meets quality standards.

		Workflow When considering the different phases that a task must pass through until it is completed, it would be best to determine when this task needs to be completed. A hard deadline is important because people need to know how to organize themselves in such a manner so that they will have the task completed on time. It would be best to consider even putting that deadline before it actually needs to be done just in case something is to go wrong.

		When creating a workflow, the main focus is fixing an issue or problem or working towards a specific goal. By determining our goal first, we can build a fine-tuned system towards our goal.
Setting clear deadlines and determining the sequence of tasks is crucial. This ensures that each part of the project is completed on time. If one team or group falls behind, it could potentially disrupt the entire project.
