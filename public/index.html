		How to implement our workflow We will use WordPress and Teams to help our class stay organized and connected. WordPress will be where students can share their work and updates. We will post our updates about our progress and that will allow everyone to stay informed about what others are doing. We also use Teams to assign tasks so that everyone knows what they are responsible for.
Expectation Group members should check in with each other to share progress.

		“A wide-ranging term that generally refers to defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary
What is content management to me? From the quote above, CM is how content is organized and presented. This can be due to how the content is organized, stored, and delivered to a person. Beyond that, with content management, it could also mean who gets to see the content and who can&rsquo;t.

		According to Deane Barker content management is, &ldquo;&ldquo;A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.&rdquo;&rdquo;
Content managment to me means, the management of man made entertainment, information, etc that is meant to be consumed by humans.
An example of content management is a Wix template
This is a good example of content management because you are able to manage information and have it organized using a website template from Wix.

		What is it? Content Management is referred to as &ldquo;A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.&rdquo; Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary. In my opinion it just means that there is information that is being organized or controlled using an editorial method.
What does it look like? We see examples of content management every day, especially on social media.

		What is content management? Deane Barker says that content management is the “practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content” (Barker 2016).
In my own words I would say that content management is a way to make viewing and navigating websites easier, for users and for the creators of that website as well. It is a way of organzing types of content on websites.
Example This is a photographer and youtuber that I watch all the time, he even has his own website.

Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary
What Is Content Management To Me? To me, content management is the way that content is planned, organized, structured, edited, and delivered. Content management, essentially, is just managing content.
What Is An Example Of This? An example that I thought of when thinking about content management was YouTube.

		“A wide-randing term that generally refers to the practie of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.”Barker, D.(2016). Flying Squirrel Glossary. O’Reilly Media Self-explanatory, how you handle content, like sorting, archiving, etc.
Take GameFAQs for example, where users posts are organized by things like categories, subforums, etc.
[hi] (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/)
They use content managament by letting users sorting posts (Ex. Views), pages, etc. and they let them manage their posts, like editing them

		Definition: Content management is a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content&quot; (Barker, 2024)
Explanation in own words: Content management involves handling every step of the content lifecycle, from planning and creating to reviewing, organizing, and delivering it to the audience
Real-life example: I use YouTube, an example of content management. YouTube creators upload and manage their videos, organized through channels and search algorithms.

		What is &ldquo;Content Management&rdquo; Content managemnt, according to Deane Barker is, &ldquo;a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.&rdquo;
Content Management in my own words To me I think content management is the content is organized for the consumer to see in a certain way. You could easily just put out unorganized content. However, people probably won&rsquo;t want to view it, if there is no fluid motion of your content.
