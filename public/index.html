		Phases a Task Should Pass Through Before any piece of content gets published, it should be throughly gone over until it is determined complete. Below is an idea of my on how we could structure these phases:
Planning Phase We need to define our goals. We need to get input from our peers and client. We need to see what we have to work with, and overview what is already there.

		&ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown.&rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.
One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.

		According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &ldquo;&ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;
To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.
An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.
This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.

		Presentation &ldquo;content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; Mauricio Harp
What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

		What is Presentation and what does it look like? Usually associated with content, but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple&rsquo;s new ios 18 where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.

		What is Presentation?
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)
In my words
Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the actual content itself.

		What is &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; &ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; (Mauricio Harp).
Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.

		Presentation is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to Barker.
To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible
One example of presentation is on UK&rsquo;s website. What we see here is the actual content of the page presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing!

		“The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.” (Barker, 2013).
You could say it&rsquo;s the aesthetic of something, like how someone shows themselves to others by how they dress, theie maneruisms, etc.
KDE Themes
I&rsquo;ll use Linux (KDE to be exact) as an example, as you&rsquo;re given different themes and one of them can change the general look of the desktop which can affect things like spacing

What is Presentation To Me? To me, presentation is how content is displayed. It is what you see when you go to a webpage or an application, and it is anything with a graphical user interface.
