		WordPress will be our CMS, and we will use it to manage our content, from creating and managing posts and themes to ensuring the website is consistent and that information is updated. We will use teams to communicate and collaborate on our assigned parts and ensure others are doing their part. We also use teams to share files and task assignments. Using WordPress, we can see what people have done or changed.

		How will it be done? We will have our multiple types of tasks separated into categories on Microsoft Teams, where the different groups can access them. Then, we can use those tasks to divide the work in WordPress. As far as the expectations of each person, it goes without saying that we expect everyone to do their role and, if they are struggling with their role, to ask for assistance. This can be done through teams or through our canvas shell.

		Implementing our workflow
We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to implement our workflow by assigning specific roles to class members and managing the content creation process. WordPress will serve as the platform where tasks like drafting, editing, and publishing content will take place. Each class member will have a designated role, such as editor, writer, or project manager, allowing us to streamline content production and ensure that responsibilities are clear.

Wordpress will be used for draft pages and making sure that everything looks correct and is working before it is finalized. As well as figuring out what theme we as a class are going to use.
Expectations Teams: There tasks will be assigned, you are expected to complete your own tasks on time.

		Mission Word press will be the actual working environment we will utilize. Here we will actually edit the project and implement our brainstormed, assigned tasks. MS Teams will be how we coordinate this project between groups. Propose ideas, assign work, strategize, and the main form of class communication.
Expectations Every team member will be responsible for their own share. Not one member should feel expected to do everything. Team members should be expected of contributing to the overall mission, regardless of their roles.

		Use WordPress as a platform for publishing and managing content for the GMS class project. WordPress allows us to organize tasks and review posts for approval. Microsoft Teams will serve as communication. Teams will be used to assign tasks and report on progress. Team members can update each other on the status, flag issues, and feedback on drafts before final submission. Other technologies, like Google Docs, can be used to collaborate on drafts before moving content to WordPress for final publishing.

		We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to implement our workflow by instilling a process of steps to help implement workflow. Primarily, WordPress can be used for content management as we can use this program to put each student in their chosen roles, such as an editor or project manager. We can then utilize Teams to help create communication lines between the various groups and roles as well as creating deadlines for when we need assignments completed by.
