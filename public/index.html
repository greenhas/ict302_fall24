		&ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown.&rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.
One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.

		Defining Presentation Dean Barker gave a great definition of presentation, he said that presentation is, &ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo; (Barker, 2013).
In my own words Presentation is how you view something in it&rsquo;s simpliest form. It is how you see a website, and how easiliy or hard you can navigate through it.
=======
		According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &ldquo;&ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;
To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.
An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.
This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.

		Understanding Content Aggregation Definition of Content Aggregation Content aggregation refers to the process of collecting information or content from multiple sources and presenting it in a consolidated format for users to consume. According to Deane Barker&rsquo;s book Web Content Management: systems, features, and best practices, &ldquo;content aggregation involves gathering content from external or internal sources, organizing it, and displaying it in a coherent way that adds value for the user.&rdquo; (Barker, 2016).

		Presentation &ldquo;content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; Mauricio Harp
What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

		What is Presentation and what does it look like? Usually associated with content, but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple&rsquo;s new ios 18 where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.

		What is Presentation?
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)
In my words
Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the actual content itself.

		What is Presentation? In Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content, author Deane Barker defines presentation as &ldquo;the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo; on a website that changes the way the content looks (Barker, 2013).
In other words, this means that presentation is the way that the content looks when a user visits a website. The presentation can include the font that the content is set in, the size of the font, the color of the background, and many other general visual attributes of the website.
=======
		What is &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; &ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; (Mauricio Harp).
Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.

		What is Presentation? According to Deane Barker, &ldquo;Content from its aesthetic surrounding, so the &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; is the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo;
Barker, D.(2016). Presentation. O&rsquo;Reilly Media
To my Understanding Presentation is how content is show. Regardless how presentation has changed, the content will still be the same.
Example An example of presentation is themes for Shopify. Here is an example -&gt; Shopify Theme
This is example of presentation. Shopify is a platform that lets entrepreneur sell things online.
=======
		Presentation is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to Barker.
To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible
One example of presentation is on UK&rsquo;s website. What we see here is the actual content of the page presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing!

		Content aggregation is &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary.
This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders.

		“The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.” (Barker, 2013).
You could say it&rsquo;s the aesthetic of something, like how someone shows themselves to others by how they dress, theie maneruisms, etc.
KDE Themes
I&rsquo;ll use Linux (KDE to be exact) as an example, as you&rsquo;re given different themes and one of them can change the general look of the desktop which can affect things like spacing

		What is &ldquo;content aggregation&rdquo;? According to the slides and Deane Barker, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.
Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.
An Example When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them.

		What is Content Aggregation?

I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It&rsquo;s the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?
The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed.
