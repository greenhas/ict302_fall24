		&ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown.&rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.
One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.

		According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &ldquo;&ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;
To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.
An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.
This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.

What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

		What is Presentation?
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)
In my words
Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the actual content itself.

Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.

		Presentation is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to Barker.
To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible
One example of presentation is on UK&rsquo;s website. What we see here is the actual content of the page presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing!

This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.
An Example When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them.

I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It&rsquo;s the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?
The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed.

In Deane Barker&rsquo;s words, content aggregation is, &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; (Barker).
##In my own words&hellip;
I would say that it really just makes it easier to find specific things on websites, since it uses grouping and organization.
##Examples?
First thing that comes to mind is Reddit. Reddit&rsquo;s home page is super simple and is easy to navigate for new users, Reddit Home Page .

            What is Content Aggregation? To me, content aggregation is simple; it&rsquo;s just the organization of content. Deane Barker -someone who knows a lot more than me- describes it as &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for organization or presentation.&rdquo; A straightforward definition, but content aggregation can get somewhat complex.
How is it used? One of the more common examples of content aggregation is organizing things into categories or using tags. On platforms like Instagram, people can add hashtags that go with their posts to add them to other libraries of similar content.

Content aggregation in my own words Makes it easier to find specific content on the sites UI.
Content aggregation on TikTok Tiktok for instance has a for you page (FYP) section and a following section. This gives the user the freedom to choose between fresh content from someone they don&rsquo;t follow or to watch new relased content from someone they follow.

What is Content Aggregation To Me? Content aggregation is how content is organized or laid out so that it can be viewed and navigated by users.
Examples? An example that comes to mind for me is BuzzFeed.
Here is the link to their site: https://www.buzzfeed.com/!
I used to spend a decent amount of time scrolling through their site to find fun quizzes and articles, and how they categorize their website made it easy to find a lot of different content related to things I was looking for.

The source for my definition can be found here. In my own words, presentation refers to the various aspects designed to help display content to the user. This can be achieved through both visual and information elements. One example of this concept of presentation is a YouTube video by Bryson DeChambeau.
