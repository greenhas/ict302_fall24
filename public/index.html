		&ldquo;A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.&rdquo;
Deane Barker, Web Content Management Glossary
What is a content management system to me? To me, a content management system is a software that helps users create, manage, edit, publish, and organize content. With a CMS you dont need to do much or any coding; everything is there for you to plug and play.

		Content Management System Defined As defined by Deane Barker, “A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.” (The Web Content Management Glossary, Barker 2016).
My Understanding Content Management Systems or CMS’s are software that users can use in which help them deliver and organizer content. The software can be used to make creating a website or an app more efficient since a CMS would do certain parts of the process automatically allowing the user to focus on other things.

		In WordPress students will create blog posts and project pages as documentation to track project progress. Teams will be used for daily communications, scheduling meetings, task management, and sharing quick updates. All team members must regularly update their task manager, indicating progress, blockers, and deadlines.

		WordPress will be our CMS, and we will use it to manage our content, from creating and managing posts and themes to ensuring the website is consistent and that information is updated. We will use teams to communicate and collaborate on our assigned parts and ensure others are doing their part. We also use teams to share files and task assignments. Using WordPress, we can see what people have done or changed.

		Workflow description Once everyone has taken the survey and Once tasks are assigned, We’ll use Microsoft Teams as our communication hub where the groups members can report on their work and coordinate tasks. WordPress will serve as our main content management system to publish and organize the content we produce.
Workflow Expectations Follow the Schedule and Stick to the deadlines. Regularly check-ins with your Team and Dr.Greenhalgh. Communicate frequently and help each other troubleshoot issues.

		How will it be done? We will have our multiple types of tasks separated into categories on Microsoft Teams, where the different groups can access them. Then, we can use those tasks to divide the work in WordPress. As far as the expectations of each person, it goes without saying that we expect everyone to do their role and, if they are struggling with their role, to ask for assistance. This can be done through teams or through our canvas shell.

		Implementing our workflow
We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to implement our workflow by assigning specific roles to class members and managing the content creation process. WordPress will serve as the platform where tasks like drafting, editing, and publishing content will take place. Each class member will have a designated role, such as editor, writer, or project manager, allowing us to streamline content production and ensure that responsibilities are clear.

		Workflow Description Teams will be used for task assignments that will be set by page. Said page can have their own &ldquo;Bucket&rdquo; that relates to the page. Wordpress will be used for draft pages and making sure that everything looks correct and is working before it is finalized. As well as figuring out what theme we as a class are going to use.
Expectations Teams: There tasks will be assigned, you are expected to complete your own tasks on time.

		Implementing Our Workflow with WordPress How We’ll Use WordPress WordPress is going to be our main platform for writing, editing, and publishing content. Here’s what that looks like:
Writing Posts: Each of us will create our posts in WordPress and save them as drafts until they’re ready for review. We&rsquo;ll use tags and categories to keep everything neat and easy to find.
Reviewing Content: Before anything goes live, posts will go through a review process.

		Mission Word press will be the actual working environment we will utilize. Here we will actually edit the project and implement our brainstormed, assigned tasks. MS Teams will be how we coordinate this project between groups. Propose ideas, assign work, strategize, and the main form of class communication.
Expectations Every team member will be responsible for their own share. Not one member should feel expected to do everything. Team members should be expected of contributing to the overall mission, regardless of their roles.
