Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary
What Is Content Management To Me? To me, content management is the way that content is planned, organized, structured, edited, and delivered. Content management, essentially, is just managing content.
What Is An Example Of This? An example that I thought of when thinking about content management was YouTube.

		Definition: Content management is a wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content&quot; (Barker, 2024)
Explanation in own words: Content management involves handling every step of the content lifecycle, from planning and creating to reviewing, organizing, and delivering it to the audience
Real-life example: I use YouTube, an example of content management. YouTube creators upload and manage their videos, organized through channels and search algorithms.

		Content management Definition &ldquo;A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary
In other words, &ldquo;Content management is how we handle the information we share on websites and apps. It&rsquo;s all about keeping everything in order so people can find what they need easily.&rdquo;
Example: A example of content management is Netflix. They add new movies and TV shows, organize them by genre, and update recommendations based on what users watch.

		For our GMS class project, a content management workflow that follows several phases to ensure tasks are completed. First, the project manager assigns tasks based on the team&rsquo;s needs. The content creator develops the content. Once completed, the content moves into the review phase, where another team member checks for accuracy and alignment with project goals. An editor refines the content, ensuring it is ready for submission. The final approvers does one last check before the content is published or submitted.

In My Own Words
To my understanding, content management is something a human do make sure what they&rsquo;re publishing is understandable to other humans.
Content Management Example An exmaple of content is news articles. News article is something a human has to create, organize, review, approve, published, and finally deliver to the public.

In Flying Squirrel Glossary, author Deane Barker defines content management as a &ldquo;wide-ranging&rdquo; term that refers to the &ldquo;practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content&rdquo; (Barker, 2016).
