		Phases a Task Should Pass Through Before any piece of content gets published, it should be throughly gone over until it is determined complete. Below is an idea of my on how we could structure these phases:
Planning Phase We need to define our goals. We need to get input from our peers and client. We need to see what we have to work with, and overview what is already there.

		&ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown.&rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.
One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.

		According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &ldquo;&ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;
To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.
An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.
This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.

		Presentation &ldquo;content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; Mauricio Harp
What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

		What is Presentation and what does it look like? Usually associated with content, but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple&rsquo;s new ios 18 where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.

		What is Presentation?
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)
In my words
Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the actual content itself.

		What is &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; &ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; (Mauricio Harp).
Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.

		Presentation is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to Barker.
To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible
One example of presentation is on UK&rsquo;s website. What we see here is the actual content of the page presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing!

		“The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.” (Barker, 2013).
You could say it&rsquo;s the aesthetic of something, like how someone shows themselves to others by how they dress, theie maneruisms, etc.
KDE Themes
I&rsquo;ll use Linux (KDE to be exact) as an example, as you&rsquo;re given different themes and one of them can change the general look of the desktop which can affect things like spacing

What is Presentation To Me? To me, presentation is how content is displayed. It is what you see when you go to a webpage or an application, and it is anything with a graphical user interface.

          What is Content? According to the slides and Deane Barker, content is created by editorial process and intended for consumption by a human audience. To me, content is anything we humans create and put onto the internet. Anything from blogposts, to videos, to music, to images: all of it is content!
An Example One example of content in action is this awesome video by Claire Saffitz. In this video, she demonstrates one of her recipes from her book.

            <h2 id="what-is-presentation">What is Presentation?</h2>
<p>In <em>Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content</em>, author Deane Barker defines presentation as &ldquo;the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo; on a website that changes the way the content looks (Barker, 2013).</p>
<p>In other words, this means that presentation is the way that the content looks when a user visits a website. The presentation can include the font that the content is set in, the size of the font, the color of the background, and many other general visual attributes of the website. From my own personal experience, I know that the content can even be changed by the user. In short, presentation is just how the website looks to the visitor.</p>

<p>According to Deane Barker, &ldquo;Content from its aesthetic surrounding, so the &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; is the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barker, D.(2016). <a href="https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/presentation/">Presentation</a>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media</p>
<h2 id="to-my-understanding">To my Understanding</h2>
<p>Presentation is how content is show. Regardless how presentation has changed, the content will still be the same.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>An example of presentation is themes for Shopify. Here is an example -&gt;
<a href="https://themes.shopify.com/themes">Shopify Theme</a></p>
<p>This is example of presentation. Shopify is a platform that lets entrepreneur sell things online. In Shopify user can change the theme easily while keeping their content the same. Keeping what they&rsquo;re selling still in the website. There is more than just themes to change, user can change how they want to show their products, changing colors, and etc. All for a better experince for the consumer, different themes can boost sales.</p>

<p>The definition of this concept is <em>&ldquo;Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; is the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo;</em> (Barker, 2016)</p>
<p>In other words, the explanation for this concept is <em>&ldquo;The presentation refers to how content is visually framed and displayed but the content remains the same.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>One example I use is <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram’s dark mode</a>. Instagram allows users to change between a light mode and a dark mode, where the background switches to black, and fonts and icons adjust to maintain visibility.</p>

            <p>Content aggregation is &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary.</p>
<p>This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders. This is executing intentional grouping of content. As for some of my trips, I purposefully group them in a file and can then sort by my rating, date, and location where I took the photos. You can get nit-picky in which you want to organize the images.</p>

<p>According to the slides and <em>Deane Barker</em>, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.</p>
<p>Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/?f=flair_name%3A%22Video%20Game%22">Liminal Spaces Subreddit</a>, I linked to the flairs that specified &ldquo;Video Games&rdquo;. Therefore, I can find posts easily that match that description!</p>

            <p>What is Content Aggregation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O&rsquo;Reilly Media</p>
<p>I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It&rsquo;s the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?</p>
<p>The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed. Youtube will organize other content based of your subscriptions, watched, liked or disliked videos. Thus presenting you with options they believe you may like.</p>
