      <description>What is Content? &amp;ldquo;Definition of Content&amp;rdquo; Content would be something that users create and is &amp;ldquo;intended for consumption by a human audience&amp;rdquo; (Barker, 2016)&#xA;My Definition would be technically anything can be content; however, it needs to have that editorial process and needs to be consumed by humans in the simplest of terms.&#xA;Content that I regularly consume&#xA;If I ever feel like some of my photos are lacking any substance, I usually check out this website my link The reason that this website is content is that this is made for a human audiences, for creatives that are looking to find inspiration or try and recreate a visual shot.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;content Dash talks about the phrase user generated content and how the people who generated this conent did not like the way the phrase represented them. He also talks about how a lot of younger people today refer to themselves as content creators. (Richman, 2022)&#xA;In my own words I think content is any form of consumable visual element that someone makes for someone else to view.</description>

      <description>Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication. In my own words, content is information available for either retrieval or engagement intended for users and people. One example of content that I consume regularly are golf youtube videos posted by Bryson DeChambeau. Here is my link This example illustrates the concept of content as I, the user, engage with the information, the video of Bryson golfing and giving tips as he plays, and by watching it I consume it, and the videos are edited before they are posted.</description>
