      <description>&amp;ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary&#xA;What is Content Aggregation To Me? Content aggregation is how content is organized or laid out so that it can be viewed and navigated by users.&#xA;Examples? An example that comes to mind for me is BuzzFeed.&#xA;Here is the link to their site: https://www.buzzfeed.com/!&#xA;I used to spend a decent amount of time scrolling through their site to find fun quizzes and articles, and how they categorize their website made it easy to find a lot of different content related to things I was looking for.</description>

      <description>Presentation refers to the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on various medias and devices to provide a specific experience for the user. The source for my definition can be found here. In my own words, presentation refers to the various aspects designed to help display content to the user. This can be achieved through both visual and information elements. One example of this concept of presentation is a YouTube video by Bryson DeChambeau.</description>

      <description>Definition of User-Generated Content I would define User-generated content as content made by regular users or customers that is usually shared on social media or other platforms. According to the article &amp;ldquo;A Straightforward Approach to User Generated Content that Connects,&amp;rdquo; user content is is original, brand-specific content created by customers (at no cost to you) and published on social media or other channels (Oladipo, 2022).&#xA;Example: A popular platform where UGC thrives is Instagram.</description>

      <description>What is Content&#xA;From what I have read and learned, content is visual or auditory information that can be used to share information or knowledge. The slides from week two from Baker are &amp;ldquo;intended for consumption by a human audience.&amp;rdquo; I think of this as meaning data that has not been sculpted or formatted is not necessarily considered content but data. However, when curated, it becomes content or information that people can interact with.</description>

      <description>##User Generated Content&#xA;In the past week, we have discussed user-generated content and its meaning. User-generated content or media created by a human. In the Podcast Episode: Wordle and the Web We Need a Podcast on EFF, the hosts talk about the meaning and what they feel by it. One of the hosts says it was crazy that people now refer to media or art, such as music, as content and sometimes not as its correct form, even when it comes from the heart.</description>

      <description>Definition of UGC User-generated content refers to &amp;ldquo;content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website&amp;rdquo; (Source: user-generated content and CMS extensions slide 14, Week 3). In my own words I think UGC is content made by everyday users, like posts and reviews shared on platforms. Real-life Example: Reddit Reddit is a prime example of UGC. Users submit posts, links, and discussions across different communities. For instance, in r/technology , users can share and discuss tech news, showing how the platform relies on user-generated content.</description>

      <description>“Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.” Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media&#xA;I understand this concept as the creation of something with humans as the consumers. Videos, movies, podcasts, interviews, books and journals are some examples. Authors write books with the hopes that someone consumes them, i.e. reads their work. A chef creates a dish that he hopes customers will enjoy etc.</description>

      <description>Content as defined by Deane Barker, “Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.” Barker, D.( 2016). My definition of content if fairly simple, anything that humans consume that is created by humans. Some examples of content would be websites, movies, and even YouTube videos. A movie is an example of content because it was created by humans and intended for human consumption.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;content Dash talks about the phrase user generated content and how the people who generated this conent did not like the way the phrase represented them. He also talks about how a lot of younger people today refer to themselves as content creators. (Richman, 2022)&#xA;In my own words I think content is any form of consumable visual element that someone makes for someone else to view.</description>

      <description>Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication. In my own words, content is information available for either retrieval or engagement intended for users and people. One example of content that I consume regularly are golf youtube videos posted by Bryson DeChambeau. Here is my link This example illustrates the concept of content as I, the user, engage with the information, the video of Bryson golfing and giving tips as he plays, and by watching it I consume it, and the videos are edited before they are posted.</description>

      <description>Content is &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.&amp;rdquo; Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media. To me, this means content that is produced by humans for human interaction.&#xA;Some content I regularly consume are YouTube videos(youtube.com). This aligns with the definitions because the videos are content that has been created by a human, edited, and then made for human consumption.</description>
