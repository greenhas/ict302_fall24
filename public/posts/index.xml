      <description>Phases a Task Should Pass Through Before any piece of content gets published it should be throughly gone over until it is determined complete. Below is an idea of my on how we could structure these phases.&#xA;Planning Phase We need to define our goals. We need to get input from our peers and client We need to see what we have to work with overview what is already there.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&amp;rsquo;s shown.&amp;rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.&#xA;One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.</description>

      <description>According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;&#xA;To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.&#xA;An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.&#xA;This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.</description>

      <description>Presentation &amp;ldquo;content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&amp;rsquo;s shown&amp;rdquo; Mauricio Harp&#xA;What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.</description>

      <description>What is Presentation and what does it look like? Usually associated with content, but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple&amp;rsquo;s new ios 18 where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.</description>

      <description>What is Presentation?&#xA;Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)&#xA;In my words&#xA;Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&amp;rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the actual content itself.</description>

It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content&#xA;Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.</description>

      <description>Presentation is specificaly the the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on devices and other channels to provide a specific experience for the user, according to Barker.&#xA;To me, I find presentation to be the aspect that you want the user to actually see, and usually removing itself from the code and back end as much as possible&#xA;One example of presentation is on UK&amp;rsquo;s website. What we see here is the actual content of the page presented in a way that looks cohesive and visually appealing!</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;content aggregation&amp;rdquo;? According to the slides and Deane Barker, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.&#xA;Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.&#xA;An Example When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them.</description>

      <description>Defining Presentation Dean Barker gave a great definition of presentation, he said that presentation is, &amp;ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&amp;rdquo; (Barker, 2013).&#xA;In my own words Presentation is how you view something in it&amp;rsquo;s simpliest form. It is how you see a website, and how easiliy or hard you can navigate through it.</description>

      <description>What is Presentation? In Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content, author Deane Barker defines presentation as &amp;ldquo;the use of colors, fonts, etc.&amp;rdquo; on a website that changes the way the content looks (Barker, 2013).&#xA;In other words, this means that presentation is the way that the content looks when a user visits a website. The presentation can include the font that the content is set in, the size of the font, the color of the background, and many other general visual attributes of the website.</description>

      <description>Presentation The definition of this concept is &amp;ldquo;Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the &amp;lsquo;presentation&amp;rsquo; is the use of colors, fonts, etc.&amp;rdquo; (Barker, 2016)&#xA;In other words, the explanation for this concept is &amp;ldquo;The presentation refers to how content is visually framed and displayed but the content remains the same.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Example One example I use is Instagram’s dark mode. Instagram allows users to change between a light mode and a dark mode, where the background switches to black, and fonts and icons adjust to maintain visibility.</description>

      <description>Content aggregation is &amp;ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&amp;rdquo; Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary.&#xA;This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders.</description>

Web Content Management. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media&#xA;I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation.

      <description>What is Content Aggregation? To me, content aggregation is simple; it&amp;rsquo;s just the organization of content. Deane Barker -someone who knows a lot more than me- describes it as &amp;ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for organization or presentation.&amp;rdquo; A straightforward definition, but content aggregation can get somewhat complex.&#xA;How is it used? One of the more common examples of content aggregation is organizing things into categories or using tags. On platforms like Instagram, people can add hashtags that go with their posts to add them to other libraries of similar content.</description>

      <description>Content Aggregation Defined “an intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organizations or presentation” (Barker, 2016).&#xA;My Interpretation of Content Aggregation My interpretation of content aggregation is that It organizes content in a logical manner in which it is easier to consume&#xA;Example of Content Aggregation - Instagram A user can easily see content from creators in that they are following simply just by scrolling. On the bottom the screen the user has the options to make a post of their own, search for specific content, access an area in which they can see content posted by anyone even if they are not following them, and view their own profile.</description>

      <description>Presentation refers to the visual elements of a piece of content that are displayed on various medias and devices to provide a specific experience for the user. The source for my definition can be found here. In my own words, presentation refers to the various aspects designed to help display content to the user. This can be achieved through both visual and information elements. One example of this concept of presentation is a YouTube video by Bryson DeChambeau.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;lsquo;content aggregation&amp;rsquo;?&#xA;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation. (Dean Barker, Web Content Management Glossary)&#xA;In my own words&#xA;Content aggregation means gathering information from different places and putting it all together in one spot. It helps people find everything they need, like news or articles, without going to many different websites.&#xA;Example&#xA;Example of content aggregation is YouTube. YouTube aggregates videos from countless creators and channels, allowing users to discover and watch a wide variety of content in one platform.</description>

      <description>Definition of User-Generated Content I would define User-generated content as content made by regular users or customers that is usually shared on social media or other platforms. According to the article &amp;ldquo;A Straightforward Approach to User Generated Content that Connects,&amp;rdquo; user content is is original, brand-specific content created by customers (at no cost to you) and published on social media or other channels (Oladipo, 2022).&#xA;Example: A popular platform where UGC thrives is Instagram.</description>

      <description>User generated content defined by Deane Barker as “Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website.” (Barker, 2016). My understanding of this definition is that user generated content is anything that someone who is using a website or app as it is intended to be used. An example of this would be reviews that are left on a restaurant’s yelp page. People (non-editors) use the app to generate their content which is a review of the restaurant.</description>

      <description>##User Generated Content&#xA;In the past week, we have discussed user-generated content and its meaning. User-generated content or media created by a human. In the Podcast Episode: Wordle and the Web We Need a Podcast on EFF, the hosts talk about the meaning and what they feel by it. One of the hosts says it was crazy that people now refer to media or art, such as music, as content and sometimes not as its correct form, even when it comes from the heart.</description>

      <description>Definition of UGC User-generated content refers to &amp;ldquo;content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website&amp;rdquo; (Source: user-generated content and CMS extensions slide 14, Week 3). In my own words I think UGC is content made by everyday users, like posts and reviews shared on platforms. Real-life Example: Reddit Reddit is a prime example of UGC. Users submit posts, links, and discussions across different communities. For instance, in r/technology , users can share and discuss tech news, showing how the platform relies on user-generated content.</description>

      <description>Content as defined by Deane Barker, “Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication.” Barker, D.( 2016). My definition of content if fairly simple, anything that humans consume that is created by humans. Some examples of content would be websites, movies, and even YouTube videos. A movie is an example of content because it was created by humans and intended for human consumption.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;content Dash talks about the phrase user generated content and how the people who generated this conent did not like the way the phrase represented them. He also talks about how a lot of younger people today refer to themselves as content creators. (Richman, 2022)&#xA;In my own words I think content is any form of consumable visual element that someone makes for someone else to view.</description>

      <description>Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication. In my own words, content is information available for either retrieval or engagement intended for users and people. One example of content that I consume regularly are golf youtube videos posted by Bryson DeChambeau. Here is my link This example illustrates the concept of content as I, the user, engage with the information, the video of Bryson golfing and giving tips as he plays, and by watching it I consume it, and the videos are edited before they are posted.</description>
