<td>Text</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>When someone posts a TikTok they are able to post text along with the video,this text can be to inform, entertain, or persuade. Users can also comment on posts for the same reasons.</td>

<tr>
<td>Audios</td>

<td>Another aspect of TikTok is sounds and audios that people can use in their videos and also you can post videos with your own sounds and you can relay information or entertainment with audio.</td>

<td>Games</td>

<tr>
<td>Lessons</td>

<td>While much of TikTok is to pursuade or entertain, there is a large enviroment for learning, people post many different kinds of informational content that can be used to learn something new.</td>

<tr>
<td>Overall</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>There are more aspects of content that I did not touch on, but overall TikTok provides users with a way to share their pieces of information, entertainment, or experience, so that they can inform, entertain, or persuade on a digital format. This to me is a prime example of content and fullfils the aspects of my definition.</td>
