		Workflow Implementation The correct implementation of Wordpress and Teams will be very beneficial to our workflow. Teams will be used for gathering ideas and turning them into tasks. There could even be different chats for different roles and elements that need to be worked on so no information gets lost. Overall, teams is going to be more of an organizational and communication factor to ensure that nobody in confused on what they need to do.

		We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to implement our workflow by instilling a process of steps to help implement workflow. Primarily, WordPress can be used for content management as we can use this program to put each student in their chosen roles, such as an editor or project manager. We can then utilize Teams to help create communication lines between the various groups and roles as well as creating deadlines for when we need assignments completed by.

		What is a Content Management System? In Web Content Management, author Deane Barker defines a content management system (CMS) as a &ldquo;software system that automates the tasks around the management of content&rdquo;. CMSs help content editors with &ldquo;controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content&rdquo; (Barker, 2016).
In other words, this means that a content management system is a technology that allows a webmaster, website creator, or website administrator to create content and display it to users.

		What is Content Management System? According to Deane Barker, &ldquo;A software system which autmates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.&rdquo;
Barker, D.(2016). Web Content Management Glossary O&rsquo;Reilly Media
To my Understanding Content management system is a platform that holds the content that people are publicly seeing. Its a easier way for people who dont know how to code to show their content on the web.

		Workflow Description First, we will post the required tasks to Microsoft Teams, moving them into the &ldquo;Brainstorming&rdquo; section on Teams first. Once the tasks have been brainstormed, they will be assigned to the relevant teams for drafting. Once the groups have drafted their work, the assigned project manager people will look it over and then show it to Dr. Greenhalgh for final feedback. If feedback is made, it will be fixed by the editors or designers before being finalized and actually implemented on the website.

		Definition &ldquo;A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.&rdquo;
Deane Barker, Web Content Management Glossary
In other words, a CMS lets you build and run a website without having to be a web developer.
Example A example of a CMS is my favorite recipe blog, Apple Pie by Grandma Ople. The person running the blog can add new recipes, edit old ones, and organize all the content in categories like “pie” or “cakes.

		How to implement our workflow We will use WordPress and Teams to help our class stay organized and connected. WordPress will be where students can share their work and updates. We will post our updates about our progress and that will allow everyone to stay informed about what others are doing. We also use Teams to assign tasks so that everyone knows what they are responsible for.
Expectation Group members should check in with each other to share progress.

		“A wide-ranging term that generally refers to defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary
What is content management to me? From the quote above, CM is how content is organized and presented. This can be due to how the content is organized, stored, and delivered to a person. Beyond that, with content management, it could also mean who gets to see the content and who can&rsquo;t.
