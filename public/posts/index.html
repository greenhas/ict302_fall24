		<p>We will use WordPress, Teams, and other technologies to <strong>implement our workflow</strong> by instilling a process of steps to help implement workflow. Primarily, WordPress can be used for content management as we can use this program to put each student in their chosen roles, such as an editor or project manager. We can then utilize Teams to help create communication lines between the various groups and roles as well as creating deadlines for when we need assignments completed by. These processes can help create a seamless workflow that enhances productivity and collaboration.
When looking at reasonable expectations for how class members will use those technologies to communicate and report on their workflow actions, this can be accomplished by using Teams to communicate, such as updating the overall class and specifically tasked groups about deadlines and assignments. Additionally, we can use these resources to give feedback to fellow classmates regarding their work and timeline factor.</p>

		<h2 id="what-is-a-content-management-system">What is a Content Management System?</h2>
<p>In <em>Web Content Management</em>, author Deane Barker defines a content management system (CMS) as a &ldquo;software system that automates the tasks around the management of content&rdquo;. CMSs help content editors with &ldquo;controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content&rdquo; (Barker, 2016).</p>
<p>In other words, this means that a content management system is a technology that allows a webmaster, website creator, or website administrator to create content and display it to users. CMSs make it so a user doesn&rsquo;t have to follow many steps, they just have to use the CMS, and content can be created and deployed automatically.</p>

<p>First, we will post the required tasks to Microsoft Teams, moving them into the &ldquo;Brainstorming&rdquo; section on Teams first. Once the tasks have been brainstormed, they will be assigned to the relevant teams for drafting. Once the groups have drafted their work, the assigned project manager people will look it over and then show it to Dr. Greenhalgh for final feedback. If feedback is made, it will be fixed by the editors or designers before being finalized and actually implemented on the website.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deane Barker, Web Content Management Glossary</p>
<p>In other words, a CMS lets you build and run a website without having to be a web developer.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A example of a CMS is my favorite recipe blog, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/">Apple Pie by Grandma Ople</a>. The person running the blog can add new recipes, edit old ones, and organize all the content in categories like “pie” or “cakes.”</p>

<p>We will use WordPress and Teams to help our class stay organized and connected. WordPress will be where students can share their work and updates. We will post our updates about our progress and that will allow everyone to stay informed about what others are doing. We also use Teams to assign tasks so that everyone knows what they are responsible for.</p>
<h2 id="expectation">Expectation</h2>
<p>Group members should check in with each other to share progress. Attendance at meetings is important and we should report the outcomes of these meetings.</p>

		<p>“A wide-ranging term that generally refers to defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content. - Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel Glossary</p>
<p>What is content management to me? From the quote above, CM is how content is organized and presented. This can be due to how the content is organized, stored, and delivered to a person. Beyond that, with content management, it could also mean who gets to see the content and who can&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>According to Deane Barker content management is, <strong>&ldquo;&ldquo;A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.&rdquo;&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Content managment to me means, the management of man made entertainment, information, etc that is meant to be consumed by humans.</p>
<p>An example of content management is a <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix template</a></p>
<p>This is a good example of content management because you are able to manage information and have it organized using a website template from Wix.</p>
