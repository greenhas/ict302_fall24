		What is &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; &ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; (Mauricio Harp).
Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.

            Content aggregation is &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary.
This means to me what tools or ways we can organize information, such as adding tags to files, dates, or names. A real-life case of this is when I use Lightroom for photography. Lightroom allows the user to organize their photos by metadata and other methods, such as keywords, ratings, titles that can be created, and folders to separate groups of folders.

            What is &ldquo;content aggregation&rdquo;? According to the slides and Deane Barker, content aggregation is a purposeful grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation.
Personally, I would describe content aggregation as using specific classifying aspects of content, and using them to group similar things together.
An Example When I think of content aggregation, I think about Reddit! One of my favorite subreddits aggregates specific flairs, and each post that falls under it is organized under them.

            What is Content Aggregation?
&ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; Barker, D. (2016). Web Content Management. O&rsquo;Reilly Media
I immediately think to myself that content aggregation is more like content presentation. It&rsquo;s the presentation of what the content is, how its organized, what links to it? How is it portrayed to an audience. How does the user see the content?
The example I have for content aggregation would be something like an individuals youtube feed.

            ##Defining &ldquo;Content Aggregation&rdquo;
In Deane Barker&rsquo;s words, content aggregation is, &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation&rdquo; (Barker).
##In my own words&hellip;
I would say that it really just makes it easier to find specific things on websites, since it uses grouping and organization.
##Examples?
First thing that comes to mind is Reddit. Reddit&rsquo;s home page is super simple and is easy to navigate for new users, Reddit Home Page .

            What is Content Aggregation? To me, content aggregation is simple; it&rsquo;s just the organization of content. Deane Barker -someone who knows a lot more than me- describes it as &ldquo;An intentional grouping of content for organization or presentation.&rdquo; A straightforward definition, but content aggregation can get somewhat complex.
How is it used? One of the more common examples of content aggregation is organizing things into categories or using tags. On platforms like Instagram, people can add hashtags that go with their posts to add them to other libraries of similar content.

Content aggregation in my own words Makes it easier to find specific content on the sites UI.
Content aggregation on TikTok Tiktok for instance has a for you page (FYP) section and a following section. This gives the user the freedom to choose between fresh content from someone they don&rsquo;t follow or to watch new relased content from someone they follow.

		What is Presentation? In Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content, author Deane Barker defines presentation as &ldquo;the use of colors, fonts, etc.&rdquo; on a website that changes the way the content looks (Barker, 2013).
In other words, this means that presentation is the way that the content looks when a user visits a website. The presentation can include the font that the content is set in, the size of the font, the color of the background, and many other general visual attributes of the website.

To my Understanding Presentation is how content is show. Regardless how presentation has changed, the content will still be the same.
Example An example of presentation is themes for Shopify. Here is an example -&gt; Shopify Theme
This is example of presentation. Shopify is a platform that lets entrepreneur sell things online.

In other words, the explanation for this concept is &ldquo;The presentation refers to how content is visually framed and displayed but the content remains the same.&rdquo;
Example One example I use is Instagram’s dark mode. Instagram allows users to change between a light mode and a dark mode, where the background switches to black, and fonts and icons adjust to maintain visibility.
