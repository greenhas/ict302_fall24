		Different Phases There are several different phases that a task should pass through before it is marked complete. First, the task should be brainstormed; we should actually think about what we want to work on with the site. The brainstorming step would also include assigning someone to work on the post. Next, once the task has been brainstormed, we need to actually draft the task - we need to fix the site in whatever way we brainstormed about.

		&ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown.&rdquo; -Mauricio Harp. For me, the quote by Mauricio Harp best explains what a presentation is. I would also say it can be how information is represented, such as charts or visuals, as well as text, in an easy way to communicate an idea.
One instance for me is the news app on my phone. Of course, writers could post articles without formatting.

		According to Deane Barker Presentation is, &ldquo;&ldquo;The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;
To me, presentation is something where content is organized together to share information about something at once.
An example of presention is this link of a presentation I was apart of.
This is relevant to my definition because it is a way to share different types of information and content at the same time in a certain format.

		Presentation &ldquo;content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; Mauricio Harp
What is presentation to me in regards to content To myself, like Mauricio points out, presentation is the visuals of content. The way the content is portrayed and how its viewed. I think of it like taking a picture. For example, I could take a picture of my physical computer monitor using my cellphone but visually the image will be distorted and unclear compared to a screenshot.

		What is Presentation and what does it look like? Usually associated with content, but the two of them work hand in hand. Content is the information that is being communicated, and presentation is how it is displayed. A recent example of this is found within Apple&rsquo;s new ios 18 where users can now use a dark mode on their home screens. This new feature alters the look of your apps and home screen, but all of the data and information you are seeing is the same.

		What is Presentation?
Presentation is the general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered. (Deane Barker, Web Content Management glossary)
In my words
Presentation refers to how information is displayed or shown. It&rsquo;s about the look of the content, such as the layout, fonts, colors, and style. It determines how users see and interact with the material, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the actual content itself.

		What is &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; &ldquo;Content is the raw data, while presentation is how it&rsquo;s shown&rdquo; (Mauricio Harp).
Presentation in my own words Good preseentation can make the content you want to produce stand out among other version of similar content. It also needs to be aimed toward the consumer not just the people producing the content
Presentation in Canvas Canvas has a great presentation as it is aimed toward college students.
