		Workflow Description First, we will post the required tasks to Microsoft Teams, moving them into the &ldquo;Brainstorming&rdquo; section on Teams first. Once the tasks have been brainstormed, they will be assigned to the relevant teams for drafting. Once the groups have drafted their work, the assigned project manager people will look it over and then show it to Dr. Greenhalgh for final feedback. If feedback is made, it will be fixed by the editors or designers before being finalized and actually implemented on the website.

In My Own Words
To my understanding, content management is something a human do make sure what they&rsquo;re publishing is understandable to other humans.
Content Management Example An exmaple of content is news articles. News article is something a human has to create, organize, review, approve, published, and finally deliver to the public.

		What is Content Management? In Flying Squirrel Glossary, author Deane Barker defines content management as a &ldquo;wide-ranging&rdquo; term that refers to the &ldquo;practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content&rdquo; (Barker, 2016).
In other words, this means that content management is the process of working with and processing the content that a user sees on a particular platform before the user gets to see the content.

		Definition &quot; The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usaually through templating. A template apllied will result in output which is then delivered.&quot; -Deanne Barker, *web content management glossary
In my own words Presentation is how content is adapted and displayed depending on the platform. This is done by applying templates that determine the structure and layout of the content.
Example Canva. Canva is an online tool for graphic design that helps users create different types of visual content.

		Phases First, we will start by defining our project objectives so everyone understands what we want to accomplish. Then, we will break down the project into smaller tasks and assign them based on each person’s strengths. Then we should set deadlines to keep us on track and ensures timely completion. Once tasks are completed, we’ll compile drafts for review to get feddbacks from everyone.

		Task Phases I think there should be couple phases for the tasks starting with deciding what the task is and how indepth it will be. Next, we should decide which part of the website the task belongs to, is it part fo the main home page or is it part of an external link? Once that&rsquo;s figured out that will determine who it goes to and they can begin to work on it.

		content creation work flow:
Before starting to work on our class project, we should consider the following steps: Brain storming: This is where content ideas are brainstormed, aligned with overall goals, and scheduled. Content Creation: this is where we start creating content after brainstorming our ideas. Review &amp; Editing: after creating our content, we review the content for accuracy, grammar, and overall quality. Approval &amp; Final Review: after we have edited and review the content, we will have stakeholders take a look at the content for a final review and approve the content.

		WORKFLOW PHASES:
Plannig Phase: In this phase,the task is clearly defined. The goals, deadlines, and required deliverables are identified. Roles are assigned to classmates, and expectations are set.
Creating Phase: In this phase we produce the content itself, whether it&rsquo;s writing, designing visuals, or creating multimedia.
Reviewing Phase: After the content is created, it is passed to one or more reviewers for feedback. This phase ensures that the content is accurate, aligns with project goals, and meets quality standards.

		Workflow When considering the different phases that a task must pass through until it is completed, it would be best to determine when this task needs to be completed. A hard deadline is important because people need to know how to organize themselves in such a manner so that they will have the task completed on time. It would be best to consider even putting that deadline before it actually needs to be done just in case something is to go wrong.
